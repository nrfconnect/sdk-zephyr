Build System

Kernel

Boards
******

* All boards based on Nordic ICs that used the ``nrfjprog`` Nordic command-line
  tool for flashing by default have been modified to instead default to the new
  nRF Util (``nrfutil``) tool. This means that you may need to `install nRF Util
  <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-util>`_ or, if you
  prefer to continue using ``nrfjprog``, you can do so by invoking west while
  specfying the runner: ``west flash -r nrfjprog``. The full documentation for
  nRF Util can be found
  `here <https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/README.html>`_.

  :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/bluetooth/conn.h` have been renamed
  to ``BT_LE_CS_TONE_ANTENNA_CONFIGURATION_A<NUMBER>_B<NUMBER>``.
