Migration guide to Zephyr v4.2.0 (Working Draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required when migrating your application from Zephyr v4.1.0 to
Zephyr v4.2.0.

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_4.2>`.

Build System

Kernel

Boards
******

* All boards based on Nordic ICs that used the ``nrfjprog`` Nordic command-line
  tool for flashing by default have been modified to instead default to the new
  nRF Util (``nrfutil``) tool. This means that you may need to `install nRF Util
  <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-util>`_ or, if you
  prefer to continue using ``nrfjprog``, you can do so by invoking west while
  specfying the runner: ``west flash -r nrfjprog``. The full documentation for
  nRF Util can be found
  `here <https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrfutil/page/README.html>`_.

Device Drivers and Devicetree
*****************************

Bluetooth
*********

Bluetooth Audio
===============

* ``CONFIG_BT_CSIP_SET_MEMBER_NOTIFIABLE`` has been renamed to
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CSIP_SET_MEMBER_SIRK_NOTIFIABLE``. (:github:`86763``)

Bluetooth Host
==============

* The symbols ``BT_LE_CS_TONE_ANTENNA_CONFIGURATION_INDEX_<NUMBER>`` in
  :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/bluetooth/conn.h` have been renamed
  to ``BT_LE_CS_TONE_ANTENNA_CONFIGURATION_A<NUMBER>_B<NUMBER>``.

Networking
**********

* The struct ``net_linkaddr_storage`` has been renamed to struct
  :c:struct:`net_linkaddr` and the old struct ``net_linkaddr`` has been removed.
  The struct :c:struct:`net_linkaddr` now contains space to store the link
  address instead of having pointer that point to the link address. This avoids
  possible dangling pointers when cloning struct :c:struct:`net_pkt`. This will
  increase the size of struct :c:struct:`net_pkt` by 4 octets for IEEE 802.15.4,
  but there is no size increase for other network technologies like Ethernet.
  Note that any code that is using struct :c:struct:`net_linkaddr` directly, and
  which has checks like ``if (lladdr->addr == NULL)``, will no longer work as expected
  (because the addr is not a pointer) and must be changed to ``if (lladdr->len == 0)``
  if the code wants to check that the link address is not set.

* TLS credential type ``TLS_CREDENTIAL_SERVER_CERTIFICATE`` was renamed to
  more generic :c:enumerator:`TLS_CREDENTIAL_PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE` to better
  reflect the purpose of this credential type.

SPI
===

* Renamed the device tree property ``port_sel`` to ``port-sel``.
* Renamed the device tree property ``chip_select`` to ``chip-select``.
