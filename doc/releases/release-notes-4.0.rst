############################

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr version 4.0.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

An overview of the changes required or recommended when migrating your application from Zephyr
v3.7.0 to Zephyr v4.0.0 can be found in the separate :ref:`migration guide<migration_4.0>`.

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Security Vulnerability Related
******************************
The following CVEs are addressed by this release:

More detailed information can be found in:
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/security/vulnerabilities.html

* CVE-2024-8798: Under embargo until 2024-11-22

API Changes
***********

* Removed deprecated arch-level CMSIS header files
  ``include/zephyr/arch/arm/cortex_a_r/cmsis.h`` and
  ``include/zephyr/arch/arm/cortex_m/cmsis.h``. ``cmsis_core.h`` needs to be
  included now.

* Removed deprecated ``ceiling_fraction`` macro. :c:macro:`DIV_ROUND_UP` needs
  to be used now.

* Deprecated ``EARLY``, ``APPLICATION`` and ``SMP`` init levels can no longer be
  used for devices.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* Macro ``K_THREAD_STACK_MEMBER``, deprecated since v3.5.0, has been removed.
  Use :c:macro:`K_KERNEL_STACK_MEMBER` instead.
* ``CBPRINTF_PACKAGE_COPY_*`` macros, deprecated since Zephyr 3.5.0, have been removed.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Deprecated the :c:func:`net_buf_put` and :c:func:`net_buf_get` API functions in favor of
  :c:func:`k_fifo_put` and :c:func:`k_fifo_get`.

* The :ref:`kscan_api` subsystem has been marked as deprecated.

Architectures
*************

* ARC

* ARM

* ARM64

  * Added initial support for :c:func:`arch_stack_walk` that supports unwinding via esf only

* RISC-V

  * The stack traces upon fatal exception now prints the address of stack pointer (sp) or frame
    pointer (fp) depending on the build configuration.

  * When :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EXTRA_EXCEPTION_INFO` is enabled, the exception stack frame (arch_esf)
    has an additional field ``csf`` that points to the callee-saved-registers upon an fatal error,
    which can be accessed in :c:func:`k_sys_fatal_error_handler` by ``esf->csf``.

    * For SoCs that select ``RISCV_SOC_HAS_ISR_STACKING``, the ``SOC_ISR_STACKING_ESF_DECLARE`` has to
      include the ``csf`` member, otherwise the build would fail.

* Xtensa

* x86

  * Added initial support for :c:func:`arch_stack_walk` that supports unwinding via esf only

Kernel
******

Bluetooth
*********

* Audio

  * :c:func:`bt_tbs_client_register_cb` now supports multiple listeners and may now return an error.

* Host

  * Added API :c:func:`bt_gatt_get_uatt_mtu` to get current Unenhanced ATT MTU of a given
    connection (experimental).

* HCI Drivers

Boards & SoC Support
********************

* Added support for these SoC series:

* Made these changes in other SoC series:

  * NXP S32Z270: Added support for the new silicon cut version 2.0. Note that the previous
    versions (1.0 and 1.1) are no longer supported.

* Added support for these boards:

* Made these board changes:

  * :ref:`native_posix<native_posix>` has been deprecated in favour of
    :ref:`native_sim<native_sim>`.
  * Support for Google Kukui EC board (``google_kukui``) has been dropped.
  * STM32: Deprecated MCO configuration via Kconfig in favour of setting it through devicetree.
    See ``samples/boards/stm32/mco`` sample.

* Added support for the following shields:

Build system and Infrastructure
*******************************

* Added support for .elf files to the west flash command for jlink, pyocd and linkserver runners.

Documentation
*************

 * Added two new build commands, ``make html-live`` and ``make html-live-fast``, that automatically locally
   host the generated documentation. They also automatically rebuild and rehost the documentation when changes
   to the input ``.rst`` files are detected on the filesystem.
