Zephyr 4.0.0 (Working Draft)
############################

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr version 4.0.0.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* The introduction of the :ref:`secure storage<secure_storage>` subsystem. It allows the use of the
  PSA Secure Storage API and of persistent keys in the PSA Crypto API on all board targets. It
  is now the standard way to provide device-specific protection to data at rest. (:github:`76222`)

An overview of the changes required or recommended when migrating your application from Zephyr
v3.7.0 to Zephyr v4.0.0 can be found in the separate :ref:`migration guide<migration_4.0>`.

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Security Vulnerability Related
******************************
The following CVEs are addressed by this release:

More detailed information can be found in:
https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/security/vulnerabilities.html

* CVE-2024-8798: Under embargo until 2024-11-22

API Changes
***********

* Removed deprecated arch-level CMSIS header files
  ``include/zephyr/arch/arm/cortex_a_r/cmsis.h`` and
  ``include/zephyr/arch/arm/cortex_m/cmsis.h``. ``cmsis_core.h`` needs to be
  included now.

* Removed deprecated ``ceiling_fraction`` macro. :c:macro:`DIV_ROUND_UP` needs
  to be used now.

* Deprecated ``EARLY``, ``APPLICATION`` and ``SMP`` init levels can no longer be
  used for devices.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* Macro ``K_THREAD_STACK_MEMBER``, deprecated since v3.5.0, has been removed.
  Use :c:macro:`K_KERNEL_STACK_MEMBER` instead.
* ``CBPRINTF_PACKAGE_COPY_*`` macros, deprecated since Zephyr 3.5.0, have been removed.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Deprecated the :c:func:`net_buf_put` and :c:func:`net_buf_get` API functions in favor of
  :c:func:`k_fifo_put` and :c:func:`k_fifo_get`.

* The :ref:`kscan_api` subsystem has been marked as deprecated.

* The TinyCrypt library was marked as deprecated (:github:`79566`). The reasons
  for this are (:github:`43712``):

  * the upstream version of this library is unmaintained.

  * to reduce the number of crypto libraries available in Zephyr (currently there are
    3 different implementations: TinyCrypt, MbedTLS and PSA Crypto APIs).

  The PSA Crypto API is now the de-facto standard to perform crypto operations.

Architectures
*************

* ARC

* ARM

* ARM64

  * Added initial support for :c:func:`arch_stack_walk` that supports unwinding via esf only

* RISC-V

  * The stack traces upon fatal exception now prints the address of stack pointer (sp) or frame
    pointer (fp) depending on the build configuration.

  * When :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EXTRA_EXCEPTION_INFO` is enabled, the exception stack frame (arch_esf)
    has an additional field ``csf`` that points to the callee-saved-registers upon an fatal error,
    which can be accessed in :c:func:`k_sys_fatal_error_handler` by ``esf->csf``.

    * For SoCs that select ``RISCV_SOC_HAS_ISR_STACKING``, the ``SOC_ISR_STACKING_ESF_DECLARE`` has to
      include the ``csf`` member, otherwise the build would fail.

* Xtensa

* x86

  * Added initial support for :c:func:`arch_stack_walk` that supports unwinding via esf only

Kernel
******

Bluetooth
*********

* Audio

  * :c:func:`bt_tbs_client_register_cb` now supports multiple listeners and may now return an error.

  * Added APIs for getting and setting the assisted listening stream values in codec capabilities
    and codec configuration:

    * :c:func:`bt_audio_codec_cfg_meta_get_assisted_listening_stream`
    * :c:func:`bt_audio_codec_cfg_meta_set_assisted_listening_stream`
    * :c:func:`bt_audio_codec_cap_meta_get_assisted_listening_stream`
    * :c:func:`bt_audio_codec_cap_meta_set_assisted_listening_stream`

* Host

  * Added API :c:func:`bt_gatt_get_uatt_mtu` to get current Unenhanced ATT MTU of a given
    connection (experimental).
  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_NOTIFY_WQ`.
    The option allows using a separate workqueue for connection TX notify processing
    (:c:func:`bt_conn_tx_notify`) to make Bluetooth stack more independent from the system workqueue.

  * The host now disconnects from the peer upon ATT timeout.

  * Added a warning to :c:func:`bt_conn_le_create` and :c:func:`bt_conn_le_create_synced` if
    the connection pointer passed as an argument is not NULL.

  * Added Kconfig option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN_CHECK_NULL_BEFORE_CREATE` to enforce
    :c:func:`bt_conn_le_create` and :c:func:`bt_conn_le_create_synced` return an error if the
    connection pointer passed as an argument is not NULL.

* HCI Drivers

Boards & SoC Support
********************

* Added support for these SoC series:

* Made these changes in other SoC series:

  * NXP S32Z270: Added support for the new silicon cut version 2.0. Note that the previous
    versions (1.0 and 1.1) are no longer supported.

* Added support for these boards:

* Made these board changes:

  * :ref:`native_posix<native_posix>` has been deprecated in favour of
    :ref:`native_sim<native_sim>`.
  * Support for Google Kukui EC board (``google_kukui``) has been dropped.
  * STM32: Deprecated MCO configuration via Kconfig in favour of setting it through devicetree.
    See ``samples/boards/stm32/mco`` sample.
  * Removed the ``nrf54l15pdk`` board, use :ref:`nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15` instead.

* Added support for the following shields:

Build system and Infrastructure
*******************************

* Added support for .elf files to the west flash command for jlink, pyocd and linkserver runners.

* Extracted pickled EDT generation from gen_defines.py into gen_edt.py. This moved the following
  parameters from the cmake variable ``EXTRA_GEN_DEFINES_ARGS`` to ``EXTRA_GEN_EDT_ARGS``:

   * ``--dts``
   * ``--dtc-flags``
   * ``--bindings-dirs``
   * ``--dts-out``
   * ``--edt-pickle-out``
   * ``--vendor-prefixes``
   * ``--edtlib-Werror``

* Switched to using imgtool directly from the build system when signing images instead of calling
  ``west sign``.

Documentation
*************

 * Added two new build commands, ``make html-live`` and ``make html-live-fast``, that automatically locally
   host the generated documentation. They also automatically rebuild and rehost the documentation when changes
   to the input ``.rst`` files are detected on the filesystem.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Debug

* Demand Paging

* Formatted output

* Management

  * MCUmgr

    * Added support for :ref:`mcumgr_smp_group_10`, which allows for listing information on
      supported groups.
    * Fixed formatting of milliseconds in :c:enum:`OS_MGMT_ID_DATETIME_STR` by adding
      leading zeros.
    * Added support for custom os mgmt bootloader info responses using notification hooks, this
      can be enabled witbh :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_OS_BOOTLOADER_INFO_HOOK`, the data
      structure is :c:struct:`os_mgmt_bootloader_info_data`.
    * Added support for img mgmt slot info command, which allows for listing information on
      images and slots on the device.

  * hawkBit

    * :c:func:`hawkbit_autohandler` now takes one argument. If the argument is set to true, the
      autohandler will reshedule itself after running. If the argument is set to false, the
      autohandler will not reshedule itself. Both variants are sheduled independent of each other.
      The autohandler always runs in the system workqueue.

    * Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_autohandler_wait` function to wait for the autohandler to finish.

    * Running hawkBit from the shell is now executed in the system workqueue.

    * Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_autohandler_cancel` function to cancel the autohandler.

    * Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_autohandler_set_delay` function to delay the next run of the
      autohandler.

    * The hawkBit header file was separated into multiple header files. The main header file is now
      ``<zephyr/mgmt/hawkbit/hawkbit.h>``, the autohandler header file is now
      ``<zephyr/mgmt/hawkbit/autohandler.h>`` and the configuration header file is now
      ``<zephyr/mgmt/hawkbit/config.h>``.

* Logging

* Modem modules

* Power management

* Crypto

  * Mbed TLS was updated to version 3.6.1. The release notes can be found at:
    https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/mbedtls-3.6.1
  * The Kconfig symbol :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG_ALLOW_NON_CSPRNG`
    was added to allow ``psa_get_random()`` to make use of non-cryptographically
    secure random sources when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG`
    is also enabled. This is only meant to be used for test purposes, not in production.
    (:github:`76408`)
  * The Kconfig symbol :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_TLS_VERSION_1_3` was added to
    enable TLS 1.3 support from Mbed TLS. When this is enabled the following
    new Kconfig symbols can also be enabled:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_TLS_SESSION_TICKETS` to enable session tickets
      (RFC 5077);
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_SSL_TLS1_3_KEY_EXCHANGE_MODE_PSK_ENABLED`
      for TLS 1.3 PSK key exchange mode;

* Random

* SD

* Shell:

  * Reorganized the ``kernel threads`` and ``kernel stacks`` shell command under the
    L1 ``kernel thread`` shell command as ``kernel thread list`` & ``kernel thread stacks``
  * Added multiple shell command to configure the CPU mask affinity / pinning a thread in
    runtime, do ``kernel thread -h`` for more info.
  * ``kernel reboot`` shell command without any additional arguments will now do a cold reboot
    instead of requiring you to type ``kernel reboot cold``.

* State Machine Framework

* Storage

  * LittleFS: The module has been updated with changes committed upstream
    from version 2.8.1, the last module update, up to and including
    the released version 2.9.3.

* Task Watchdog

* POSIX API

* LoRa/LoRaWAN

* ZBus

* JWT (JSON Web Token)
