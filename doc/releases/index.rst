Release Notes
#############

Zephyr project is provided as source code and build scripts for different
target architectures and configurations, and not as a binary image. Updated
versions of the Zephyr project are released approximately every three-months.

All Zephyr project source code is maintained in a `GitHub repository`_.

For Zephyr versions up to 1.13, you can either download source as a tar.gz file
(see the bottom of the `GitHub tagged releases`_ page corresponding to each
release), or clone the GitHub repository.

With the introduction of the :ref:`west` tool after the release of Zephyr 1.13,
it is no longer recommended to download or clone the source code manually.
Instead we recommend you follow the instructions in :ref:`get_the_code` to do
so with the help of west.

The project's technical documentation is also tagged to correspond with a
specific release and can be found at https://docs.zephyrproject.org/.
