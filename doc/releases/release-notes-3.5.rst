********************

    single Flash Interface Unit (FIU) module and Direct Read Access (DRA) mode
    for better performance.

  * Added support for Nuvoton NuMaker M46x

* SPI

  * Remove npcx spi driver implemented by Flash Interface Unit (FIU) module.

* Timer

  * The TI CC13xx/26xx system clock timer compatible was changed from
    :dtcompatible:`ti,cc13xx-cc26xx-rtc` to :dtcompatible:`ti,cc13xx-cc26xx-rtc-timer`
    and the corresponding Kconfig option from :kconfig:option:`CC13X2_CC26X2_RTC_TIMER`
    to :kconfig:option:`CC13XX_CC26XX_RTC_TIMER` for improved consistency and
    extensibility. No action is required unless the internal timer was modified.

* USB

* W1

* Watchdog

* WiFi

Networking
**********

* Time and timestamps in the network subsystem, PTP and IEEE 802.15.4
  were more precisely specified and all in-tree call sites updated accordingly.
  Fields for timed TX and TX/RX timestamps have been consolidated. See
  :c:type:`net_time_t`, :c:struct:`net_ptp_time`, :c:struct:`ieee802154_config`,
  :c:struct:`ieee802154_radio_api` and :c:struct:`net_pkt` for extensive
  documentation. As this is largely an internal API, existing applications will
  most probably continue to work unchanged.

* CoAP:

  * Use 64 bit timer values for calculating transmission timeouts. This fixes potential problems for
    devices that stay on for more than 49 days when the 32 bit uptime counter might roll over and
    cause CoAP packets to not timeout at all on this event.

* LwM2M:

  * Added support for tickless mode. This removes the 500 ms timeout from the socket loop
    so the engine does not constantly wake up the CPU. This can be enabled by
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LWM2M_TICKLESS`.
  * Added new :c:macro:`LWM2M_RD_CLIENT_EVENT_DEREGISTER` event.

* Wi-Fi
  * Added Passive scan support.
  * The Wi-Fi scan API updated with Wi-Fi scan parameter to allow scan mode selection.

USB

Devicetree
**********

* ``zephyr,memory-region-mpu`` was renamed ``zephyr,memory-attr``

* The following macros were added:
  :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_NODE_VARGS`,
  :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY_NODE_VARGS`
  :c:macro:`DT_MEMORY_ATTR_FOREACH_NODE`
  :c:macro:`DT_MEMORY_ATTR_APPLY`
  :c:macro:`DT_MEM_FROM_FIXED_PARTITION`
  :c:macro:`DT_FIXED_PARTITION_ADDR`

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Management

  * Introduced MCUmgr client support with handlers for img_mgmt and os_mgmt.

  * Added response checking to MCUmgr's :c:enumerator:`MGMT_EVT_OP_CMD_RECV`
    notification callback to allow applications to reject MCUmgr commands.

  * MCUmgr SMP version 2 error translation (to legacy MCUmgr error code) is now
    supported in function handlers by setting ``mg_translate_error`` of
    :c:struct:`mgmt_group` when registering a transport. See
    :c:type:`smp_translate_error_fn` for function details.

  * Fixed an issue with MCUmgr img_mgmt group whereby the size of the upload in
    the initial packet was not checked.

  * Fixed an issue with MCUmgr fs_mgmt group whereby some status codes were not
    checked properly, this meant that the error returned might not be the
    correct error, but would only occur in situations where an error was
    already present.

  * Fixed an issue whereby the SMP response function did not check to see if
    the initial zcbor map was created successfully.

  * Fixes an issue with MCUmgr shell_mgmt group whereby the length of a
    received command was not properly checked.

  * Added optional mutex locking support to MCUmgr img_mgmt group, which can
    be enabled with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_MUTEX`.

  * Added MCUmgr settings management group, which allows for manipulation of
    zephyr settings from a remote device, see :ref:`mcumgr_smp_group_3` for
    details.

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_CONFIRM_NON_ACTIVE_IMAGE_SECONDARY`
    and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_CONFIRM_NON_ACTIVE_IMAGE_ANY`
    that allow to control whether MCUmgr client will be allowed to confirm
    non-active images.

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_ERASE_PENDING` that allows
    to erase slots pending for next boot, that are not revert slots.

* File systems

  * Added support for ext2 file system.
  * Added support of mounting littlefs on the block device from the shell/fs.
  * Added alignment parameter to FS_LITTLEFS_DECLARE_CUSTOM_CONFIG macro, it can speed up read/write
    operation for SDMMC devices in case when we align buffers on CONFIG_SDHC_BUFFER_ALIGNMENT,
    because we can avoid extra copy of data from card bffer to read/prog buffer.
