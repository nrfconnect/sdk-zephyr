* native/POSIX

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_APPLICATION` has been deprecated. Out-of-tree boards using this
    option should migrate to the native_simulator runner (:github:`81232`).
    For an example of how this was done with a board in-tree check :github:`61481`.
  * For the native_sim target :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NATIVE_SIM_NATIVE_POSIX_COMPAT` has been
    switched to ``n`` by default, and this option has been deprecated. Ensure your code does not
    use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_NATIVE_POSIX` option anymore (:github:`81232`).
