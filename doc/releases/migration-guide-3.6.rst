Migration guide to Zephyr v3.6.0 (Working Draft)
################################################

This document describes the changes required or recommended when migrating your
application from Zephyr v3.5.0 to Zephyr v3.6.0.

Any other changes (not directly related to migrating applications) can be found in
the :ref:`release notes<zephyr_3.6>`.

Required changes
****************

Kernel
======

C Library
=========

Optional Modules
================

The following modules have been made optional and are not downloaded with `west update` by default
anymore:

* ``canopennode`` (:github:`64139`)

To enable them again use the ``west config manifest.project-filter -- +<module
name>`` command, or ``west config manifest.group-filter -- +optional`` to
enable all optional modules, and then run ``west update`` again.

Device Drivers and Device Tree
==============================

* The :dtcompatible:`st,lsm6dsv16x` sensor driver has been changed to support
  configuration of both int1 and int2 pins. The DT attribute ``irq-gpios`` has been
  removed and substituted by two new attributes, ``int1-gpios`` and ``int2-gpios``.
  These attributes must be configured in the Device Tree similarly to the following
  example:

  .. code-block:: devicetree

    / {
        lsm6dsv16x@0 {
            compatible = "st,lsm6dsv16x";

            int1-gpios = <&gpioa 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
            int2-gpios = <&gpiod 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
            drdy-pin = <2>;
        };
    };

  (:github:`62994`)

* Runtime configuration is now disabled by default for Nordic UART drivers. The motivation for the
  change is that this feature is rarely used and disabling it significantly reduces the memory
  footprint.

Power Management
================

Shell
=====

* The following subsystem and driver shell modules are now disabled by default. Each required shell
  module must now be explicitly enabled via Kconfig (:github:`65307`):

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ACPI_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ADC_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_AUDIO_CODEC_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAN_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CLOCK_CONTROL_NRF_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DAC_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_DEBUG_COREDUMP_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDAC_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EEPROM_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HWINFO_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_I2C_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_CMDS`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LORA_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MDIO_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PCIE_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PSCI_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PWM_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_REGULATOR_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SENSOR_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SMBUS_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_STATS_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USBD_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USBH_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_W1_SHELL`
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WDT_SHELL`

Bootloader
==========

* MCUboot's deprecated ``CONFIG_ZEPHYR_TRY_MASS_ERASE`` Kconfig option has been removed. If an
  erase is needed when flashing MCUboot, this should now be provided directly to the ``west``
  command e.g. ``west flash --erase``. (:github:`64703`)

Bluetooth
=========

* The HCI implementation for both the Host and the Controller sides has been
  renamed for the IPC transport. The ``CONFIG_BT_RPMSG`` Kconfig option is now
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HCI_IPC`, and the ``zephyr,bt-hci-rpmsg-ipc``
  Devicetree chosen is now ``zephyr,bt-hci-ipc``. The existing sample has also
  been renamed, from ``samples/bluetooth/hci_rpmsg`` to
  ``samples/bluetooth/hci_ipc``. (:github:`64391`)
* The BT GATT callback list, appended to by :c:func:`bt_gatt_cb_register`, is no longer
  cleared on :c:func:`bt_enable`. Callbacks can now be registered before the initial
  call to :c:func:`bt_enable`, and should no longer be re-registered after a :c:func:`bt_disable`
  :c:func:`bt_enable` cycle. (:github:`63693`)
* The Bluetooth UUID has been modified to rodata in ``BT_UUID_DECLARE_16``, ``BT_UUID_DECLARE_32`
  and ``BT_UUID_DECLARE_128`` as the return value has been changed to `const`.
  Any pointer to a UUID must be prefixed with `const`, otherwise there will be a compilation warning.
  For example change ``struct bt_uuid *uuid = BT_UUID_DECLARE_16(xx)`` to
  ``const struct bt_uuid *uuid = BT_UUID_DECLARE_16(xx)``. (:github:`66136`)

* Mesh

  * The Bluetooth Mesh ``model`` declaration has been changed to add prefix ``const``.
    The ``model->user_data``, ``model->elem_idx`` and ``model->mod_idx`` field has been changed to
    the new runtime structure, replaced by ``model->rt->user_data``, ``model->rt->elem_idx`` and
    ``model->rt->mod_idx`` separately. (:github:`65152`)
  * The Bluetooth Mesh ``element`` declaration has been changed to add prefix ``const``.
    The ``elem->addr`` field has been changed to the new runtime structure, replaced by
    ``elem->rt->addr``. (:github:`65388`)
  * Deprecated :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_PROV_DEVICE`. This option is
    replaced by new option :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_PROVISIONEE` to
    be aligned with Mesh Protocol Specification v1.1, section 5.4. (:github:`64252`)

LoRaWAN
=======

* The API to register a callback to provide battery level information to the LoRaWAN stack has been
  renamed from ``lorawan_set_battery_level_callback`` to
  :c:func:`lorawan_register_battery_level_callback` and the return type is now ``void``. This
  is more consistent with similar functions for downlink and data rate changed callbacks.
  (:github:`65103`)

Networking
==========

* The CoAP public API has some minor changes to take into account. The
  :c:func:`coap_remove_observer` now returns a result if the observer was removed. This
  change is used by the newly introduced :ref:`coap_server_interface` subsystem. Also, the
  ``request`` argument for :c:func:`coap_well_known_core_get` is made ``const``.
  (:github:`64265`)

* CoAP observer events have moved from a callback function in a CoAP resource to the Network Events
  subsystem. The ``CONFIG_COAP_OBSERVER_EVENTS`` configuration option has been removed.
  (:github:`65936`)

* The CoAP public API function :c:func:`coap_pending_init` has changed. The parameter
  ``retries`` is replaced with a pointer to :c:struct:`coap_transmission_parameters`. This allows to
  specify retransmission parameters of the confirmable message. It is safe to pass a NULL pointer to
  use default values.
  (:github:`66482`)

* The CoAP public API functions :c:func:`coap_service_send` and :c:func:`coap_resource_send` have
  changed. An additional parameter pointer to :c:struct:`coap_transmission_parameters` has been
  added. It is safe to pass a NULL pointer to use default values. (:github:`66540`)

* The IGMP multicast library now supports IGMPv3. This results in a minor change to the existing
  api. The :c:func:`net_ipv4_igmp_join` now takes an additional argument of the type
  ``const struct igmp_param *param``. This allows IGMPv3 to exclude/include certain groups of
  addresses. If this functionality is not used or available (when using IGMPv2), you can safely pass
  a NULL pointer. IGMPv3 can be enabled using the Kconfig ``CONFIG_NET_IPV4_IGMPV3``.
  (:github:`65293`)

* The network stack now uses a separate IPv4 TTL (time-to-live) value for multicast packets.
  Before, the same TTL value was used for unicast and multicast packets.
  The IPv6 hop limit value is also changed so that unicast and multicast packets can have a
  different one. (:github:`65886`)

Other Subsystems
================

* MCUmgr applications that make use of serial transports (shell or UART) must now select
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CRC`, this was previously erroneously selected if MCUmgr was enabled,
  when for non-serial transports it was not needed. (:github:`64078`)

* Touchscreen drivers :dtcompatible:`focaltech,ft5336` and
  :dtcompatible:`goodix,gt911` were using the incorrect polarity for the
  respective ``reset-gpios``. This has been fixed so those signals now have to
  be flagged as :c:macro:`GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW` in the devicetree. (:github:`64800`)

Recommended Changes
*******************

* New macros available for ST sensor DT properties setting. These macros have a self-explanatory
  name that helps in recognizing what the property setting means (e.g. LSM6DSV16X_DT_ODR_AT_60Hz).
  (:github:`65410`)
