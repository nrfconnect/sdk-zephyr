Kernel APIs
###########

This section contains APIs for the kernel's core services,
as described in the :ref:`kernel`.

.. important::
    Unless otherwise noted these APIs can be used by threads, but not by ISRs.

Threads
*******

A thread is an independently scheduled series of instructions that implements
a portion of an application's processing. Threads are used to perform processing
that is too lengthy or too complex to be performed by an ISR.
(See :ref:`threads_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: thread_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Workqueues
**********

A workqueue processes a series of work items by executing the associated
functions in a dedicated thread. Workqueues are typically used by an ISR
or high-priority thread to offload non-urgent processing.
(See :ref:`workqueues_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: workqueue_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Clocks
******

Kernel clocks enable threads and ISRs to measure the passage of time
with either normal and high precision.
(See :ref:`clocks_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: clock_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Timers
******

Timers enable threads to measure the passage of time, and to optionally execute
an action when the timer expires.
(See :ref:`timers_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: timer_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Memory Slabs
************

Memory slabs enable the dynamic allocation and release of fixed-size
memory blocks.
(See :ref:`memory_slabs_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: mem_slab_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Memory Pools
************

Memory pools enable the dynamic allocation and release of variable-size
memory blocks.
(See :ref:`memory_pools_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: mem_pool_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Heap Memory Pool
****************

The heap memory pools enable the dynamic allocation and release of memory
in a :cpp:func:`malloc()`-like manner.
(See :ref:`heap_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: heap_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Semaphores
**********

Semaphores provide traditional counting semaphore capabilities.
(See :ref:`semaphores_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: semaphore_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Mutexes
*******

Mutexes provide traditional reentrant mutex capabilities
with basic priority inheritance.
(See :ref:`mutexes_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: mutex_apis
   :project: Zephyr

FIFOs
*****

FIFOs provide traditional first in, first out (FIFO) queuing of data items
of any size.
(See :ref:`fifos_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: fifo_apis
   :project: Zephyr

LIFOs
*****

LIFOs provide traditional last in, first out (LIFO) queuing of data items
of any size.
(See :ref:`lifos_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: lifo_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Stacks
******

Stacks provide traditional last in, first out (LIFO) queuing of 32-bit
data items.
(See :ref:`stacks_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: stack_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Queues
******

.. doxygengroup:: queue_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Message Queues
**************

Message queues provide a simple message queuing mechanism
for fixed-size data items.
(See :ref:`message_queues_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: msgq_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Mailboxes
*********

Mailboxes provide an enhanced message queuing mechanism
for variable-size messages.
(See :ref:`mailboxes_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: mailbox_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Pipes
*****

Pipes provide a traditional anonymous pipe mechanism for sending
variable-size chunks of data, in whole or in part.
(See :ref:`pipes_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: pipe_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Asynchronous Polling
********************

.. doxygengroup:: poll_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)
*********************************

An interrupt service routine is a series of instructions that is
executed asynchronously in response to a hardware or software interrupt.
(See :ref:`interrupts_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: isr_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Atomic Services
***************

The atomic services enable multiple threads and ISRs to read and modify
32-bit variables in an uninterruptible manner.
(See :ref:`atomic_v2`.)

.. important::
    All atomic services APIs can be used by both threads and ISRs.

.. doxygengroup:: atomic_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Profiling
*********

.. doxygengroup:: profiling_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Floating Point Services
***********************

The floating point services enable threads to use a board's floating point
registers.
(See :ref:`float_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: float_apis
   :project: Zephyr

Ring Buffers
************

Ring buffers enable simple first in, first out (FIFO) queuing
of variable-size data items.
(See :ref:`ring_buffers_v2`.)

.. doxygengroup:: ring_buffer_apis
   :project: Zephyr
   :content-only:

Kernel Version
**************
Kernel version handling and APIs related to kernel version being used.

.. doxygengroup:: version_apis
   :project: Zephyr
   :content-only:

Memory Domain
*************

A memory domain contains some number of memory partitions. Threads can
specify the range and attribute (access permission) for memory partitions
in a memory domain. Threads in the same memory domain have the
same access permissions to the memory partitions belong to the
memory domain.
(See :ref:`memory_domain`.)

   :project: Zephyr
