Planned Features
================

Additional west features are under development for future versions of
Zephyr. These include:

- Multiple manifest files: support for having multiple files which have
  manifest data, instead of the single :file:`west.yml` supported today.
  See `west #221`_.

- Toolchain awareness: see `west #180`_.

See the `west repository issues`_ page for more.
