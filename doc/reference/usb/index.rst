USB Vendor and Product identifiers
**********************************

The USB Vendor ID for the Zephyr project is 0x2FE3. The default USB Product
ID for the Zephyr project is 0x100. The USB bcdDevice Device Release Number
represents the Zephyr kernel major and minor versions as a binary coded
decimal value. When a vendor integrates the Zephyr USB subsystem into a
product, the vendor must use the USB Vendor and Product ID assigned to them.
A vendor integrating the Zephyr USB subsystem in a product must not use the
Vendor ID of the Zephyr project.

The USB maintainer, if one is assigned, or otherwise the Zephyr Technical
Steering Committee, may allocate other USB Product IDs based on well-motivated
and documented requests.

Each USB sample has its own unique Product ID.
When adding a new sample, add a new entry in :file:`samples/subsys/usb/usb_pid.Kconfig`
and a Kconfig file inside your sample subdirectory.
The following Product IDs are currently used:

* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_CDC_ACM_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_CDC_ACM_COMPOSITE_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_HID_CDC_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_CONSOLE_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_DFU_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_HID_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_HID_MOUSE_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_MASS_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_TESTUSB_SAMPLE`
* :option:`CONFIG_USB_PID_WEBUSB_SAMPLE`

USB device controller drivers
*****************************

The Device Controller Driver Layer implements the low level control routines
to deal directly with the hardware. All device controller drivers should
implement the APIs described in file usb_dc.h. This allows the integration of
new USB device controllers to be done without changing the upper layers.

USB device core layer
*********************

The USB Device core layer is a hardware independent interface between USB
device controller driver and USB device class drivers or customer applications.
It's a port of the LPCUSB device stack. It provides the following
functionalities:

   * Responds to standard device requests and returns standard descriptors,
     essentially handling 'Chapter 9' processing, specifically the standard
     device requests in table 9-3 from the universal serial bus specification
     revision 2.0.
   * Provides a programming interface to be used by USB device classes or
     customer applications. The APIs are described in the usb_device.h file.
   * Uses the APIs provided by the device controller drivers to interact with
     the USB device controller.

USB device class drivers
************************

To initialize the device class driver instance the USB device class driver
should call :c:func:`usb_set_config()` passing as parameter the instance's
configuration structure.

For example, for USB loopback application:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../subsys/usb/class/loopback.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: usb.rst config structure start
   :end-before: usb.rst config structure end
   :linenos:

Endpoint configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../subsys/usb/class/loopback.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: usb.rst endpoint configuration start
   :end-before: usb.rst endpoint configuration end
   :linenos:

USB Device configuration structure:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../subsys/usb/class/loopback.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: usb.rst device config data start
   :end-before: usb.rst device config data end
   :linenos:

For the Composite USB Device configuration is done by composite layer,
otherwise:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../subsys/usb/class/loopback.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: usb.rst configure USB controller start
   :end-before: usb.rst configure USB controller end
   :linenos:

To enable the USB device for host/device connection:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../subsys/usb/class/loopback.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: usb.rst enable USB controller start
   :end-before:  usb.rst enable USB controller end
   :linenos:

The vendor device requests are forwarded by the USB stack core driver to the
class driver through the registered class handler.

For the loopback class driver, :c:func:`loopback_vendor_handler` processes
the vendor requests:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../subsys/usb/class/loopback.c
   :language: c
   :start-after: usb.rst vendor handler start
   :end-before:  usb.rst vendor handler end
   :linenos:

The class driver waits for the :makevar:`USB_DC_CONFIGURED` device status code
before transmitting any data.

Testing USB over USP/IP in native_posix
***************************************

Virtual USB controller implemented through USB/IP might be used to test USB
Device stack. Follow general build procedure to build USB sample for
the native_posix configuration.

Run built sample with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make run

In a terminal window, run the following command to list USB devices:

.. code-block:: console

   $ usbip list -r localhost
   Exportable USB devices
   ======================
    - 127.0.0.1
           1-1: unknown vendor : unknown product (2fe3:0100)
              : /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.2/usb1/1-1
              : (Defined at Interface level) (00/00/00)
              :  0 - Vendor Specific Class / unknown subclass / unknown protocol (ff/00/00)

In a terminal window, run the following command to attach USB device:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo usbip attach -r localhost -b 1-1

The USB device should be connected to your Linux host, and verified with the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo usbip port
   Imported USB devices

              -> remote bus/dev 001/002
   $ lsusb -d 2fe3:0100
   Bus 007 Device 004: ID 2fe3:0100

API Reference
*************

There are two ways to transmit data, using the 'low' level read/write API or
the 'high' level transfer API.

Low level API
  To transmit data to the host, the class driver should call usb_write().
  Upon completion the registered endpoint callback will be called. Before
  sending another packet the class driver should wait for the completion of
  the previous write. When data is received, the registered endpoint callback
  is called. usb_read() should be used for retrieving the received data.
  For CDC ACM sample driver this happens via the OUT bulk endpoint handler
  (cdc_acm_bulk_out) mentioned in the endpoint array (cdc_acm_ep_data).

High level API
  The usb_transfer method can be used to transfer data to/from the host. The
  transfer API will automatically split the data transmission into one or more
  USB transaction(s), depending endpoint max packet size. The class driver does
  not have to implement endpoint callback and should set this callback to the
  generic usb_transfer_ep_callback.
