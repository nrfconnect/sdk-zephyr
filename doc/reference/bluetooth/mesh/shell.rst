Bluetooth Mesh Shell
####################

The Bluetooth mesh shell subsystem provides a set of Bluetooth mesh shell commands for the :ref:`shell_api` module.
It allows for testing and exploring the Bluetooth mesh API through an interactive interface, without having to write an application.

The Bluetooth mesh shell interface provides access to most Bluetooth mesh features, including provisioning, configuration, and message sending.

Prerequisites
*************

The Bluetooth mesh shell subsystem depends on the application to create the composition data and do the mesh initialization.

Application
***********

The Bluetooth mesh shell subsystem is most easily used through the Bluetooth mesh shell application under ``tests/bluetooth/mesh_shell``.
See :ref:`shell_api` for information on how to connect and interact with the Bluetooth mesh shell application.

Basic usage
***********

The Bluetooth mesh shell subsystem adds a single ``mesh`` command, which holds a set of sub-commands. Every time the device boots up, make sure to call ``mesh init`` before any of the other Bluetooth mesh shell commands can be called::

	uart:~$ mesh init

Provisioning
============

The mesh node must be provisioned to become part of the network. This is only necessary the first time the device boots up, as the device will remember its provisioning data between reboots.

The simplest way to provision the device is through self-provisioning. To provision the device with the default network key and address ``0x0001``, execute::

	uart:~$ mesh provision 0 0x0001

Since all mesh nodes use the same values for the default network key, this can be done on multiple devices, as long as they're assigned non-overlapping unicast addresses. Alternatively, to provision the device into an existing network, the unprovisioned beacon can be enabled with ``mesh pb-adv on`` or ``mesh pb-gatt on``. The beacons can be picked up by an external provisioner, which can provision the node into its network.

Once the mesh node is part of a network, its transmission parameters can be controlled by the general configuration commands:

* To set the destination address, call ``mesh dst <addr>``.
* To set the network key index, call ``mesh netidx <NetIdx>``.
* To set the application key index, call ``mesh appidx <AppIdx>``.

By default, the transmission parameters are set to send messages to the provisioned address and network key.

Configuration
=============

By setting the destination address to the local unicast address (``0x0001`` in the ``mesh provision`` command above), we can perform self-configuration through any of the :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_shell_cfg_cli` commands.

A good first step is to read out the node's own composition data::

	uart:~$ mesh get-comp

This prints a list of the composition data of the node, including a list of its model IDs.

Next, since the device has no application keys by default, it's a good idea to add one::

	uart:~$ mesh app-key-add 0 0

Message sending
===============

With an application key added (see above), the mesh node's transition parameters are all valid, and the Bluetooth mesh shell can send raw mesh messages through the network.

For example, to send a Generic OnOff Set message, call::

	uart:~$ mesh net-send 82020100

.. note::
	All multibyte fields model messages are in little endian, except the opcode.

The message will be sent to the current destination address, using the current network and application key indexes. As the destination address points to the local unicast address by default, the device will only send packets to itself. To change the destination address to the All Nodes broadcast address, call::

	uart:~$ mesh dst 0xffff

With the destination address set to ``0xffff``, any other mesh nodes in the network with the configured network and application keys will receive and process the messages we send.

.. note::
	To change the configuration of the device, the destination address must be set back to the local unicast address before issuing any configuration commands.

Sending raw mesh packets is a good way to test model message handler implementations during development, as it can be done without having to implement the sending model. By default, only the reception of the model messages can be tested this way, as the Bluetooth mesh shell only includes the foundation models. To receive a packet in the mesh node, you have to add a model with a valid opcode handler list to the composition data in ``subsys/bluetooth/mesh/shell.c``, and print the incoming message to the shell in the handler callback.

Parameter formats
*****************

The Bluetooth mesh shell commands are parsed with a variety of formats:

.. list-table:: Parameter formats
	:widths: 1 4 2
	:header-rows: 1

	* - Type
	  - Description
	  - Example
	* - Integers
	  - The default format unless something else is specified. Can be either decimal or hexadecimal.
	  - ``1234``, ``0xabcd01234``
	* - Hexstrings
	  - For raw byte arrays, like UUIDs, key values and message payloads, the parameters should be formatted as an unbroken string of hexadecimal values without any prefix.
	  - ``deadbeef01234``
	* - Booleans
	  - Boolean values are denoted in the API documentation as ``<val: on, off>``.
	  - ``on``, ``off``, ``enabled``, ``disabled``, ``1``, ``0``

Commands
********

The Bluetooth mesh shell implements a large set of commands. Some of the commands accept parameters, which are mentioned in brackets after the command name. For example, ``mesh lpn <value: off, on>``. Mandatory parameters are marked with angle brackets (e.g. ``<NetKeyIndex>``), and optional parameters are marked with square brackets (e.g. ``[destination address]``).

The Bluetooth mesh shell commands are divided into the following groups:

.. contents::
	:depth: 1
	:local:

.. note::
	Some commands depend on specific features being enabled in the compile time configuration of the application. Not all features are enabled by default. The list of available Bluetooth mesh shell commands can be shown in the shell by calling ``mesh`` without any arguments.

General configuration
=====================

``mesh init``
-------------

	Initialize the mesh shell. This command must be run before any other mesh command.


``mesh reset <addr>``
---------------------

	reset the local mesh node to its initial unprovisioned state or reset a remote node and remove it from the network.
	* ``addr``: address of the node to reset.


``mesh lpn <value: off, on>``
-----------------------------

	Enable or disable Low Power operation. Once enabled, the device will turn off its radio and start polling for friend nodes. The device will not be able to receive messages from the mesh network until the friendship has been established.

	* ``value``: Sets whether Low Power operation is enabled.


``mesh poll``
-------------

	Perform a poll to the friend node, to receive any pending messages. Only available when LPN is enabled.


``mesh ident``
--------------

	Enable the Proxy Node Identity beacon, allowing Proxy devices to connect explicitly to this device. The beacon will run for 60 seconds before the node returns to normal Proxy beacons.


``mesh dst [destination address]``
----------------------------------

	Get or set the message destination address. The destination address determines where mesh packets are sent with the shell, but has no effect on modules outside the shell's control.

	* ``destination address``: If present, sets the new 16-bit mesh destination address. If omitted, the current destination address is printed.


``mesh netidx [NetIdx]``
------------------------

	Get or set the message network index. The network index determines which network key is used to encrypt mesh packets that are sent with the shell, but has no effect on modules outside the shell's control. The network key must already be added to the device, either through provisioning or by a Configuration Client.

	* ``NetIdx``: If present, sets the new network index. If omitted, the current network index is printed.


``mesh appidx [AppIdx]``
------------------------

	Get or set the message application index. The application index determines which application key is used to encrypt mesh packets that are sent with the shell, but has no effect on modules outside the shell's control. The application key must already be added to the device by a Configuration Client, and must be bound to the current network index.

	* ``AppIdx``: If present, sets the new application index. If omitted, the current application index is printed.


``mesh net-send <hex string>``
------------------------------

	Send a raw mesh message with the current destination address, network and application index. The message opcode must be encoded manually.

	* ``hex string`` Raw hexadecimal representation of the message to send.


Testing
=======

``mesh iv-update``
------------------

	Force an IV update.


``mesh iv-update-test <value: off, on>``
----------------------------------------

	Set the IV update test mode. In test mode, the IV update timing requirements are bypassed.

	* ``value``: Enable or disable the IV update test mode.


``mesh rpl-clear``
------------------

	Clear the replay protection list, forcing the node to forget all received messages.

.. warning::

	Clearing the replay protection list breaks the security mechanisms of the mesh node, making it susceptible to message replay attacks. This should never be performed in a real deployment.


Provisioning
============

``mesh pb-gatt <val: off, on>``

	* ``val``: Whether to enable the unprovisioned beacon printing.

.. _bluetooth_mesh_shell_cfg_cli:

Configuration Client model
==========================

The Configuration Client model is an optional mesh subsystem that can be enabled through the :kconfig:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_CFG_CLI` configuration option. If included, the Bluetooth mesh shell module instantiates a Configuration Client model for configuring itself and other nodes in the mesh network.

The Configuration Client uses the general messages parameters set by ``mesh dst`` and ``mesh netidx`` to target specific nodes. When the Bluetooth mesh shell node is provisioned, the Configuration Client model targets itself by default. When another node has been provisioned by the Bluetooth mesh shell, the Configuration Client model targets the new node. The Configuration Client always sends messages using the Device key bound to the destination address, so it will only be able to configure itself and mesh nodes it provisioned.

The Health Client uses the general messages parameters set by ``mesh dst`` and ``mesh netidx`` to target specific nodes. When the Bluetooth mesh shell node is provisioned, the Health Client model targets itself by default. When another node has been provisioned by the Bluetooth mesh shell, the Health Client model targets the new node. The Health Client always sends messages using the Device key bound to the destination address, so it will only be able to configure itself and mesh nodes it provisioned.

The Configuration database is an optional mesh subsystem that can be enabled through the :kconfig:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_CDB` configuration option. The Configuration database is only available on provisioner devices, and allows them to store all information about the mesh network. To avoid conflicts, there should only be one mesh node in the network with the Configuration database enabled. This node is the Configurator, and is responsible for adding new nodes to the network and configuring them.

	* ``addr``: Unicast address of the node, or 0 to automatically choose the lowest available address.
	* ``num-elem``: Number of elements on the node.
	* ``NetKeyIdx``: The network key the node was provisioned with.
	* ``DevKey``: Optional 128-bit device key value for the device. If omitted, a random value will be generated.


``mesh cdb-node-del <addr>``
----------------------------

	Delete a mesh node from the Configuration database. If possible, the node should be reset with ``mesh reset`` before it is deleted from the Configuration database, to avoid unexpected behavior and uncontrolled access to the network.

	* ``addr`` Address of the node to delete.


``mesh cdb-subnet-add <NeyKeyIdx> [<NetKey>]``
----------------------------------------------

	Add a network key to the Configuration database. The network key can later be passed to mesh nodes in the network. Note that adding a key to the Configuration database does not automatically add it to the local node's list of known network keys.

	* ``NetKeyIdx``: Key index of the network key to add.
	* ``NetKey``: Optional 128-bit network key value. Any missing bytes will be zero. If omitted, a random value will be generated.


``mesh cdb-subnet-del <NetKeyIdx>``
-----------------------------------

	Delete a network key from the Configuration database.

	* ``NetKeyIdx``: Key index of the network key to delete.


``mesh cdb-app-key-add <NetKeyIdx> <AppKeyIdx> [<AppKey>]``
-----------------------------------------------------------

	Add an application key to the Configuration database. The application key can later be passed to mesh nodes in the network. Note that adding a key to the Configuration database does not automatically add it to the local node's list of known application keys.

	* ``NetKeyIdx``: Network key index the application key is bound to.
	* ``AppKeyIdx``: Key index of the application key to add.
	* ``AppKey``: Optional 128-bit application key value. Any missing bytes will be zero. If omitted, a random value will be generated.


``mesh cdb-app-key-del <AppKeyIdx>``
------------------------------------

	Delete an application key from the Configuration database.

	* ``AppKeyIdx``: Key index of the application key to delete.
