Release Notes
#############

Zephyr project is provided as source code and build scripts for different
target architectures and configurations, and not as a binary image. Updated
versions of the Zephyr project are released approximately every three-months.

All Zephyr project source code is maintained in a `GitHub repository`_;
you can either download source as a tar.gz file (see the bottom of the
`GitHub tagged releases`_ page corresponding to each release), or use
Git clone and checkout commands, such as:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr
   cd zephyr
   git checkout tags/v1.13.0


The project's technical documentation is also tagged to correspond with a
specific release and can be found at https://docs.zephyrproject.org/.
