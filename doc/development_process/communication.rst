Communication and Collaboration
################################

The `Zephyr project mailing lists
<https://lists.zephyrproject.org/g/main/subgroups>`_ are used as the
primary communication tool by project members, contributors, and the
community. The mailing list is open for topics related to the project
and should be used for collaboration among team members working on the
same feature or subsystem or for discussing project direction and daily
development of the code base. In general, bug reports and issues should
be entered and tracked in the bug tracking system (`GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues>`_) and not
broadcasted to the mailing list, the same applies to code reviews. Code
should be submitted to GitHub using the appropriate tools.
