Terminology
***********

- mainline: The main tree where the core functionality and core features are
  being developed.
- subsystem/feature branch: is a branch within the same repository. In our case,
  we will use the term branch also when referencing branches not in the same
  repository, which are a copy of a repository sharing the same history.
- upstream: A parent branch the source code is based on. This is the branch you
  pull from and push to, basically your upstream.
- LTS: Long Term Support
