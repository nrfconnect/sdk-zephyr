Bug Reporting
##############

To maintain traceability and relation between proposals, changes, features, and
issues, it is recommended to cross-reference source code commits with the
relevant GitHub issues and vice versa.
Any changes that originate from a tracked feature or issue should contain a
reference to the feature by mentioning the corresponding issue or pull-request
identifiers.

At any time it should be possible to establish the origin of a change and the
reason behind it by following the references in the code.
