USB host controller driver API
##############################

The USB host controller (UHC) driver API implements the low level layer
to interface with the host controller. All USB host controller drivers
should implement the APIs described in :zephyr_file:`include/drivers/usb/uhc.h`.

UHC driver API is experimental and is subject to change without notice.
