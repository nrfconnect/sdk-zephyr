      Identity of a GPIO that is shorted to the GPIO identified in the test
      regulator enable-gpios property. This is used to confirm that signal's
      state.

      The active level in the flags cell of this must match the active level
      of the flags cell in the regulator's enable-gpios property, and the
      flags must include a PULL to the inactive level.
