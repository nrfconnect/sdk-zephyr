# device_get_binding() compares pointers first before doing strcmp().
# However, enabling coverage forces -O0 to disable any compiler
# optimizations. There would be multiple copies of the same string,
# and the code pathing doing pointer comparsion would not be tested
# at all. So add this flag to merge string constants such that
# the pointer comparison would be exercised.
