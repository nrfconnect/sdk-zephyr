# Some boards are significantly slower than others resulting in the test
# output being in the range of every few seconds to every few minutes. To
# compensate for this, one can control the number of iterations in the PI
# calculation through PI_NUM_ITERATIONS. Lowering this value will increase
# the speed of the test but it will come at the expense of precision.
