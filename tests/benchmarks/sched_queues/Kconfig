config BENCHMARK_NUM_ITERATIONS
	int "Number of iterations to gather data"
	default 1000
	help
	  This option specifies the number of times each test will be executed
	  before calculating the average times for reporting.

config BENCHMARK_NUM_THREADS
	int "Number of threads"
	default 100
	help
	  This option specifies the maximum number of threads that the test
	  will add to the ready queue. Increasing this value will places greater
	  stress on the ready queue and better highlight the performance
	  differences as the number of threads in the ready queue changes.

config BENCHMARK_RECORDING
	bool "Log statistics as records"
	default n
	help
	  Log summary statistics as records to pass results
	  to the Twister JSON report and recording.csv file(s).

config BENCHMARK_VERBOSE
	bool "Display detailed results"
	default n
	help
	  This option displays the average time of all the iterations done for
	  each thread in the tests. This generates large amounts of output. To
	  analyze it, it is recommended to redirect the output to a file.
