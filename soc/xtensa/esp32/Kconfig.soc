	  expense of slightly higher (1uA) deep sleep current consumption.
	  - "External 32kHz oscillator" allows using 32kHz clock generated by an
	  external circuit. In this case, external clock signal must be connected
	  to 32K_XN pin. Amplitude should be <1.2V in case of sine wave signal,
	  and <1V in case of square wave signal. Common mode voltage should be
	  0.1 < Vcm < 0.5Vamp, where Vamp is the signal amplitude.
	  Additionally, 1nF capacitor must be connected between 32K_XP pin and

	  By default extra delay is set to 2000us. When optimizing startup time

	  to the final octet of the base MAC address. If the number of universal MAC addresses is two,
	  only two interfaces (WiFi station and Bluetooth) receive a universally administered MAC address.
	  These are generated sequentially by adding 0 and 1 (respectively) to the base MAC address.
	  The remaining two interfaces (WiFi softap and Ethernet) receive local MAC addresses.
	  These are derived from the universal WiFi station and Bluetooth MAC addresses, respectively.
	  When using the default (Espressif-assigned) base MAC address, either setting can be used.
