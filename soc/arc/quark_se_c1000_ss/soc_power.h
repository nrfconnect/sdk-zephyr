 * @brief Put processor into low power state
 *
 * This function implements the SoC specific details necessary
 * to put the processor into available power states.
 *
 * Wake up considerations:
 * -----------------------
 *
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_CPU_LPS: Any interrupt works as wake event.
 *
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_CPU_LPS_1: Any interrupt works as wake event except
 * the ARC TIMER which is disabled.
 *
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_CPU_LPS_2: SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP wake events applies.
 *
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP: Only Always-On peripherals can wake up
 * the SoC. This consists of the Counter, RTC, GPIO 1 and AIO Comparator.
 *
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP_1: Only Always-On peripherals can wake up
 * the SoC. This consists of the Counter, RTC, GPIO 1 and AIO Comparator.
 *
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP_2: Only Always-On peripherals can wake up
 * the SoC. This consists of the Counter, RTC, GPIO 1 and AIO Comparator.
 *
 * Considerations around SYS_POWER_STATE_CPU_LPS (LPSS state):
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * LPSS is a common power state between the x86 and ARC.
 * When the two applications enter SYS_POWER_STATE_CPU_LPS,
 * the SoC will enter this lower consumption mode.
 * After wake up, this state can only be entered again
 * if the ARC wakes up and transitions again to
 * SYS_POWER_STATE_CPU_LPS. This is not required on the x86 side.

 * of interrupts may be moved into the kernel.
