Overview
********

Hexiwear is powered by a Kinetis K64 microcontroller based on the ARM Cortex-M4
core. Another Kinetis wireless MCU, the KW40Z, provides Bluetooth Low Energy
connectivity. Hexiwear also integrates a wide variety of sensors, as well as a
user interface consisting of a 1.1" 96px x 96px full color OLED display and six
capacitive buttons with haptic feedback.

- Eye-catching Smart Watch form factor with powerful, low power Kinetis K6x MCU
  and 6 on-board sensors.
- Designed for wearable applications with the onboard rechargeable battery,
  OLED screen and onboard sensors such as optical heart rate, accelerometer,
  magnetometer and gyroscope.
- Designed for IoT end node applications with the onboard sensor's such as
  temperature, pressure, humidity and ambient light.
- Flexibility to let you add the sensors of your choice nearly 200 additional
  sensors through click boards.

System Clock
============

The K64F SoC is configured to use the 12 MHz external oscillator on the board
with the on-chip PLL to generate a 120 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The K64F SoC has six UARTs. One is configured for the console, another for BT
HCI, and the remaining are not used.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Build and flash applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Configuring a Debug Probe
=========================

A debug probe is used for both flashing and debugging the board. This board is
configured by default to use the :ref:`opensda-daplink-onboard-debug-probe`,
but because Segger RTT is required for a console on KW40Z, we recommend that
you reconfigure the board for the :ref:`opensda-jlink-onboard-debug-probe`.

.. note::
   OpenSDA is shared between the K64 and the KW40Z via switches, therefore only
   one SoC can be flashed, debugged, or have an open console at a time.

Option 1: :ref:`opensda-jlink-onboard-debug-probe` (Recommended)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Install the :ref:`jlink-debug-host-tools` and make sure they are in your search
path.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`opensda-jlink-onboard-debug-probe` to program
the `OpenSDA J-Link Generic Firmware for V2.1 Bootloader`_. Check that switches
SW1 and SW2 are **on**, and SW3 and SW4 are **off**  to ensure K64F SWD signals
are connected to the OpenSDA microcontroller.

Option 2: :ref:`opensda-daplink-onboard-debug-probe`
----------------------------------------------------

Install the :ref:`pyocd-debug-host-tools` and make sure they are in your search
path.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`opensda-daplink-onboard-debug-probe` to
program the `OpenSDA DAPLink Hexiwear Firmware`_. Check that switches SW1 and
SW2 are **on**, and SW3 and SW4 are **off**  to ensure K64F SWD signals are
connected to the OpenSDA microcontroller.

Add the argument ``-DOPENSDA_FW=daplink`` when you invoke ``cmake`` or ``west
build`` to override the default runner from J-Link to pyOCD:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: hexiwear_k64
   :gen-args: -DOPENSDA_FW=daplink
   :goals: build

Configuring a Console
=====================

Regardless of your choice in debug probe, we will use the OpenSDA
microcontroller as a usb-to-serial adapter for the serial console.

Connect a USB cable from your PC to CN1.

Use the following settings with your serial terminal of choice (minicom, putty,
etc.):

- Speed: 115200
- Data: 8 bits
- Parity: None
- Stop bits: 1

Flashing
========

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: hexiwear_k64
   :goals: flash

Open a serial terminal, reset the board (press the T4 button), and you should
see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS v1.14.0-rc1 *****
   Hello World! hexiwear_k64

Debugging
=========

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: hexiwear_k64
   :goals: debug

Open a serial terminal, step through the application in your debugger, and you
should see the following message in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console

   ***** Booting Zephyr OS v1.14.0-rc1 *****
   Hello World! hexiwear_k64

Using Bluetooth
***************

Configure the KW40Z as a Bluetooth controller
=============================================

The K64 can support Zephyr Bluetooth host applications when you configure the
KW40Z as a Bluetooth controller.

#. Download and install the `KW40Z Connectivity Software`_. This package
   contains Bluetooth controller application for the KW40Z.
#. Flash the file ``tools/binaries/BLE_HCI_Modem.bin`` to the KW40Z.

Now you can build and run the sample Zephyr Bluetooth host applications on the
K64. You do not need to repeat this step each time you flash a new Bluetooth
host application to the K64.

Peripheral Heart Rate Sensor
============================

Navigate to the Zephyr ``samples/bluetooth/peripheral_hr`` sample
application, then build and flash it to the Hexiwear K64. Make sure
the OpenSDA switches on the docking station are configured for the
K64.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/bluetooth/peripheral_hr
   :board: hexiwear_k64
   :goals: build flash

Reset the KW40Z and the K64 using the push buttons on the docking station.

Install the Kinetis BLE Toolbox on your smartphone:

- `Kinetis BLE Toolbox for iOS`_
- `Kinetis BLE Toolbox for Android`_

Open the app, tap the **Heart Rate** feature, and you should see a **Zephyr
Heartrate Sensor** device. Tap the **Zephyr Heartrate Sensor** device and you
will then see a plot of the heart rate data that updates once per second.
