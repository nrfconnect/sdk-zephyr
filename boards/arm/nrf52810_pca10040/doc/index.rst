Overview
********

The nrf52810_pca10040 board is a modified version of the :ref:`nrf52_pca10040`
that enforces the limitations imposed by the nRF52810 IC, which is a
cost-reduced variant of the original nRF52832. Since Nordic does not offer a
development kit for the nRF52810 you can use this board to develop for this
IC while using the nRF52 Development Kit (PCA10040).

See :ref:`nrf52_pca10040` for more information about the development board and
`nRF52810 website`_ for the official reference on the IC itself.
