nRF54H20 PDK
############

Overview
********

The nRF54H20 PDK is a single-board preview development kit for evaluation
and development on the Nordic nRF54H20 System-on-Chip (SoC).

The nRF54H20 is a multicore SoC with:

* an Arm Cortex-M33 core with DSP instructions, FPU, and Armv8-M Security
  Extensions, running at up to 320 MHz, referred to as the **application core**
* an Arm Cortex-M33 core with DSP instructions, FPU, and Armv8-M Security
  Extensions, running at up to 256 MHz, referred to as the **radio core**.

The ``nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20_cpuapp`` build target provides support for
the application core on the nRF54H20 SoC.
The ``nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20_cpurad`` build target provides support for
the radio core on the nRF54H20 SoC.

nRF54H20 SoC provides support for the following devices:

* :abbr:`ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)`
* CLOCK
* :abbr:`GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)`
* :abbr:`GPIOTE (General Purpose Input Output tasks and events)`
* :abbr:`GRTC (Global real-time counter)`
* :abbr:`I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)`
* MRAM
* :abbr:`PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)`
* RADIO (Bluetooth Low Energy and 802.15.4)
* :abbr:`SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)`
* :abbr:`UART (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter)`
* :abbr:`USB (Universal Serial Bus)`
* :abbr:`WDT (Watchdog Timer)`

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for both the ``nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20_cpuapp`` and
``nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20_cpurad`` targets can be built, flashed,
and debugged in the usual way. See :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details on building and running.

Flashing
========

As an example, this section shows how to build and flash the :ref:`hello_world`
application.

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`.

To build and program the sample to the nRF54H20 PDK, complete the following steps:

First, connect the nRF54H20 PDK to you computer using the IMCU USB port on the PDK.
Next, build the sample by running the following command:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20_cpuapp
   :goals: build flash

Testing the LEDs and buttons in the nRF54H20 PDK
************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs
on the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky`
* :zephyr:code-sample:`button`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20/nrf54h20pdk_nrf54h20_cpuapp.dts`.
