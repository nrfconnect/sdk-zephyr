Overview
********

The Nucleo F207ZG board features an ARM Cortex-M3 based STM32F207ZG MCU
with a wide range of connectivity support and configurations. Here are
some highlights of the Nucleo F207ZG board:

- STM32 microcontroller in LQFP144 package
- Two types of extension resources:

  - ST Zio connector including: support for Arduino* Uno V3 connectivity
    (A0 to A5, D0 to D15) and additional signals exposing a wide range of
    peripherals
  - ST morpho extension pin headers for full access to all STM32 I/Os

- On-board ST-LINK/V2-1 debugger/programmer with SWD connector
- Flexible board power supply:

  - 5 V from ST-LINK/V2-1 USB VBUS
  - External power sources: 3.3 V and 7 - 12 V on ST Zio or ST morpho
    connectors, 5 V on ST morpho connector

- Three user LEDs
- Two push-buttons: USER and RESET
