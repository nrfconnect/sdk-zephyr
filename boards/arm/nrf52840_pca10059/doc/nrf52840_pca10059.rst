Connections and IOs
===================

LED
---

* LED0 (green) = P0.6
* LED1 (red)   = P0.8
* LED1 (green) = P1.9
* LED1 (blue)  = P0.12

Push buttons
------------

* BUTTON1 = SW1 = P1.6
* RESET   = SW2 = P0.18

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nrf52840_pca10059`` board configuration can be
built in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` for more details);
however, an external debugger IC is necessary to program the device,
and the standard debugging targets are not currently available.

Flashing
========

Flashing Zephyr onto the ``nrf52840_pca10059`` board requires an external
J-Link programmer. The programmer is attached to the SWD header on the back
side of the board.

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`blinky-sample` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nrf52840_pca10059
   :goals: build flash

Observe the LED on the board blinking.

Debugging
=========

The ``nrf52840_pca10059`` board does not have an on-board J-Link debug IC
as some nRF5x development boards, however, instructions from the
:ref:`nordic_segger` page also apply to this board, with the additional step
of connecting an external debugger.

Testing the LEDs and buttons on the nRF52840 PCA10059
*****************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :ref:`blinky-sample`

You can build and program the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in :file:`boards/arm/nrf52840_pca10059/board.h`.
