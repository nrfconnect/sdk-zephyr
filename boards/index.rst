Supported Boards and Shields
############################

This page lists all the boards and shields that are currently supported in Zephyr.

If you are looking to add Zephyr support for a new board, please start with the
:ref:`board_porting_guide`. When adding support documentation for a board, remember to use the
template available under :zephyr_file:`doc/templates/board.tmpl`.

Shields are hardware add-ons that can be stacked on top of a board to add extra functionality.
Refer to the :ref:`shield_porting_guide` for more information on how to port a shield.
