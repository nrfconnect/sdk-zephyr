/*
 * The basic principle of operation is:
 *   No asynchronous behavior, no indeterminism.
 *   If you run the same thing 20 times, you get exactly the same result 20
 *   times.
 *   It does not matter if you are running from console, or in a debugger
 *   and you go for lunch in the middle of the debug session.
 *
 * This is achieved as follows:
 *  The execution of native_posix is decoupled from the underlying host and its
 *  peripherals (unless set otherwise).
 *  In general, time in native_posix is simulated.
 *
 * But, native_posix can also be linked if desired to the underlying host,
 * e.g.:You can use the provided Ethernet TAP driver, or a host BLE controller.
 *
 * In this case, the no-indeterminism principle is lost. Runs of native_posix
 * will depend on the host load and the interactions with those real host
 * peripherals.
