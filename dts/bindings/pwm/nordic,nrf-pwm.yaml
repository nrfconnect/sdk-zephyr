      description: Set this to use center-aligned (up and down) counter mode.

        IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
        is not enabled. It will be deprecated in the future.

        The channel 0 pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for channel 0, set:

            ch0-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for channel 0, set:

            ch0-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

    ch0-inverted:

      required: false
      description: |
        IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
        is not enabled. It will be deprecated in the future.
        When the pin control driver is enabled, use the "nordic,invert" property
        in the corresponding pin configuration group instead.

        Set this to invert channel 0.

    ch1-pin:
      type: int
      required: false

        IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
        is not enabled. It will be deprecated in the future.

        The channel 1 pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same
        as the ch0-pin property's.

        Set this to invert channel 1.

        Set this to invert channel 2.
