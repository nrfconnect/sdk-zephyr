    This driver supports both i.MX6SX and i.MX7D PWM.
    The compatible string is named "imx27" because the hardware module is the
    same module present starting from imx27 CPUs and this driver can potentially
    support other CPUs with imx27 module. This is also the same string used
    in the Linux kernel.

compatible: "fsl,imx27-pwm"

include: [pwm-controller.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml, base.yaml, "nxp,rdc-policy.yaml"]

properties:
