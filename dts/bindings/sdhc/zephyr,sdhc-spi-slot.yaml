    type: int

    description: |
      Time in ms for SPI SDHC to delay when toggling power to the SD card. This

  spi-clock-mode-cpol:
    type: boolean

      only when the clock goes low when not active.

  spi-clock-mode-cpha:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Clock phase: this dictates when is the data captured, and depends
      on the clock's polarity. When mode-cpol is set and this option as well,
