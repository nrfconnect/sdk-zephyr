  Zephyr W1 GPIO node

  This defines a one-wire driver through GPIO bit-banging.

  For example:

  / {
        w1: w1 {
                 compatible = "zephyr,w1-gpio";
                 gpios = <&gpio0 13 (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN | GPIO_PULL_UP)>;
         };
  };

  Above:
    - w1 is pin 13 on gpio0. The gpio is active when the pin is high, is
      configured as an open-drain, and has a pull-up resistor.

compatible: "zephyr,w1-gpio"

include: [w1-master.yaml]

properties:
  gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
