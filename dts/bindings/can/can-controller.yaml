properties:
    bus-speed:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: bus speed in Baud/s
    sjw:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Resynchronization jump width (ISO 11898-1)
    prop-seg:
      type: int
      description: Time quantums of propagation segment (ISO 11898-1)
    phase-seg1:
      type: int
      description: Time quantums of phase buffer 1 segment (ISO 11898-1)
    phase-seg2:
      type: int
      description: Time quantums of phase buffer 2 segment (ISO 11898-1)
    sample-point:
      type: int
      description: >
        Sample point in permille.
        This param is required if segments are not given.
        If the sample point is given, the segments are ignored.
    phys:
      type: phandle
      description: |
        Actively controlled CAN transceiver.

        Example:
          transceiver0: can-phy0 {
            compatible = "nxp,tja1040", "can-transceiver-gpio";
            standby-gpios = <gpioa 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
            max-bitrate = <1000000>;
            #phy-cells = <0>;
          };

          &can0 {
            status = "okay";

            phys = <&transceiver0>;
          };

child-binding:
    description: |
      Passive CAN transceiver. The child node must be named "can-transceiver".

      Example:
        &can0 {
          status = "okay";

          can-transceiver {
            max-bitrate = <1000000>;
          };
        };

    properties:
      max-bitrate:
        type: int
        required: true
        description: |
          The maximum bitrate supported by the CAN transceiver in bits/s.
