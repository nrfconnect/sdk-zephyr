    Aosong DHT (Digital-output Humidity and Temperature Sensor)

    The Aosong DHT family of sensors provide temperature and humidity
    measurements through a bidirectional serial digital signal.  The
    DHT11 uses a polymer humidity capacitor with NTC thermistor; the
    DHT22 replaces the thermistor with a DS18B20 1-wire thermometer.

    The DHT22 is also known as an AM2303.
