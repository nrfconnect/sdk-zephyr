properties:
    irq-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
        The INT signal default configuration is active-high.  The
        property value should ensure the flags properly describe the
        signal that is presented to the driver.
        This property is required when the trigger mode is used.

    gyro-sr-div:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Default gyrscope sample rate divider. This divider is only effective
        when gyro-dlpf is in range 5-184.
        rate = sample_rate / (1 + gyro-sr-div)
        Valid range: 0 - 255

    gyro-dlpf:
      type: int
      required: true

    gyro-fs:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Default full scale of gyroscope. (Unit - DPS).
        Maps to GYRO_FS_SEL field in Gyroscope Configuration setting.
