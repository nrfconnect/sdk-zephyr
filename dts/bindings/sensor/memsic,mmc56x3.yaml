description: MMC56X3 3-axis magnetic and temperature sensor

compatible: "memsic,mmc56x3"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:

  magn-odr:
    type: int
    description: |
      Specify the default magnetometer output data rate expressed in
      samples per second (Hz) for continuous mode. Minimum is 0,
      maximum is 1000, though any ODR above 255 will be set to 1000.
      Setting ODR to 0 will turn off continuous mode. Temperature
      cannot be read in continuous mode.

  bandwidth-selection-bits-0:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Adjust length of decimation filter. Controls duration of each measurement.
      Affects ODR; see datasheet for details.

  bandwidth-selection-bits-1:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Adjust length of decimation filter. Controls duration of each measurement.
      Affects ODR; see datasheet for details.

  auto-self-reset:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable automatic self-reset function.
      Recommended to be set.
      Affects ODR; see datasheet for details.
