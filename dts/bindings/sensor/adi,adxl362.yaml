    int1-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
        The INT1 signal defaults to active high as produced by the
        sensor.  The property value should ensure the flags properly
        describe the signal that is presented to the driver.

        checking for motion only about six times a second.

      description: |
        Enter Wake-Up mode when inactivity is detected,
        reenter Measurement mode when activity is detected.
