      DRDY pin

      This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
      the signal that is presented to the driver.

  drdy-pin:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1 # drdy is generated from INT1
      - 2 # drdy is generated from INT2
    description: |
      Select DRDY pin number (1 or 2).

      This number represents which of the two interrupt pins
      (INT1 or INT2) the drdy line is attached to. This property is not
      mandatory and if not present it defaults to 1 which is the
      configuration at power-up.
