        Value of the configuration register
        e.g shunt voltage and bus voltage ADC conversion
        times and averaging, operating mode for INA230 or
        delay for initial ADC conversion, shunt full scale range
        for INA237.

        This value should be selected so that measurement resolution is
        maximized, that is:

          current-lsb(A) = maximum expected current(A) / 2^15

        (sensor has 15 bits). For example, if maximum expected current is 15A:

          current-lsb(A) = 15A / 2^15 ~= 457uA

        Rounded values may be used for convenience, e.g. 500uA/LSB or 1mA/LSB
        while keeping a good measurement resolution. The units are in uA/LSB
        so that low maximum currents can be measured with enough resolution.
