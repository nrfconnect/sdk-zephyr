description: Generic NTC Thermistor

include: [sensor-device.yaml]

properties:
  io-channels:
    required: true
    description: |
      ADC IO channel connected to this NTC thermistor.

  pullup-uv:
    type: int
    description: |
      The pullup voltage microvoltage in the circuit.
      If not specified, it is assumed that the pullup voltage is VDD. Therefore,
      the specified ADC IO channel must be configured so that VDD is used as the
      reference voltage.

  pullup-ohm:
    type: int
    description: |
      The pullup resistance in the circuit.

  pulldown-ohm:
    type: int
    description: |
      The pulldown resistance in the circuit.

  connected-positive:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates how the thermistor is connected in series with a pull-up and/or
      a pull-down resistor. If this flag is NOT specified, the thermistor is
      assumed to be connected-ground, which usually means a pull-down resistance
      of zero but complex arrangements are possible.
