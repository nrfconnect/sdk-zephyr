  LM77 digital temperature sensor

compatible: "lm77"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      description: |
        Identifies the INT signal, which is active-low open drain by default
        when produced by the sensor.

    int-inverted:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        When present, the polarity on the INT signal is inverted (active-high).

    tcrita-inverted:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        When present, the polarity on the T_CRIT_A signal is inverted
        (active-high).

    enable-fault-queue:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        When present, the fault queue is enabled. The fault queue allows up to 4
        faults to prevent false INT/T_CRIT_A tripping when the LM77 is used in
        noisy environments.
