      Negative Temperature Coefficient

      Set when the sensor's value is inversely proportional to temperature
      (i.e., the sensor's value decreases as the temperature increases).

      This is visible in the formula used for temperature calculation, which has the
      form "Calibration_Value - ADC_Value" rather than "ADC_Value - Calibration_Value".
