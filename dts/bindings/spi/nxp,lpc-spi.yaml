properties:
    pre-delay:
      type: int
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds inserted between chip select assert to the first
        clock edge. If not set, no additional delay is inserted.

    post-delay:
      type: int
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds inserted between the last clock edge to the chip
        select deassert. If not set, no additional delay is inserted.

    frame-delay:
      type: int
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds inserted between data frames when chip select is
        asserted and the EOF flag is set. If not set, no additional delay is
        inserted.

    transfer-delay:
      type: int
      description: |
        Delay in nanoseconds inserted between transfers when chip select is
        deasserted. If not set, no additional delay is inserted.

    def-char:
      type: int
      description: |
          Default character clocked out when the TX buffer pointer is NULL.
