            Index of the LED on a controller. It can be used by drivers or
            applications to map a logical LED to its real position on the
            controller. For example, this allows to handle boards where the
            LEDs in an array/strip are not wired following the LED order of
            the controller.
        color-mapping:
          type: array
          description: |
            Channel to color mapping of a multicolor LED. If a LED supports
            several colors, then the color-mapping property can be used to
            describe how the hardware channels and the colors are mapped.

            For example the channel to color mapping of RGB LEDs would be

               color-mapping =
                    <LED_COLOR_ID_RED>,
                    <LED_COLOR_ID_GREEN>,
                    <LED_COLOR_ID_BLUE>;
