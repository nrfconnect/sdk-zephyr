  reg:
    required: true

  lm-reg:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables the Last Mile regulator, which regulates an external 1.5V
      voltage on V15 down to the core and logic supply (V11 power domain),
      which is typically 1.1V.
      When enabling PLL as system clock, the PMC Last Mile regulator should
      be enabled.

  lm-reg-auto:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables to turn over automatically from Boot Regulator Mode to Last Mile
      regulator mode and vice versa, depending on the V15 voltage status.
      When configuring system clocks higher than FIRC clock frequency,
      lm-reg should be also enabled.

  lm-reg-base-control:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable this if an external BJT between VDD_HV_A and V15 is used on the
      PCB. The base of this BJT must be connected to the VRC_CTRL pin and is
      controlled by the PMC to regulate a voltage of 1.5V on V15 pin.
