      Functional Reset Escalation threshold.
      If the value of this property is 0, the Functional reset escalation
      function is disabled. Any other value is the number of Functional
      resets that causes a Destructive reset, if the FRET register isn't
      written to beforehand.
      Default to maximum threshold (hardware reset value).

  dest-reset-threshold:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

      Destructive Reset Escalation threshold.
      If the value of this property is 0, the Destructive reset escalation
      function is disabled. Any other value is the number of Destructive
      resets which keeps the chip in the reset state until the next power-on
      reset triggers a new reset sequence, if the DRET register isn't
      written to beforehand.
      Default to disabled (hardware reset value).
