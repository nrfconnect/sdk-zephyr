    description: |
      The prescaler value defines the counter frequency
      (clock-frequency/prescaler) in atcpit100 counter driver, the prescaler
      value could be in range [1 .. clock-frequency] and 1 means no prescaler
      for the PIT clock-frequency.

      Defaults to 1 to use the PIT clock-frequency as the counter frequency.

      Setting the prescaler value if the system overhead is close to or
      larger than a counter tick period, reducing the counter frequency to
      avoid imprecise counter value.

      For example, andes_v5_ae350 platform takes about 200 ~ 300 PIT
      clock cycles for counter interface, setting prescaler value to 600 in
      this case.
