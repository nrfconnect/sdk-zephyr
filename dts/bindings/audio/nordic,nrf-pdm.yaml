        The CLK pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for CLK, set:

            clk-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for CLK, set:

            clk-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

        The DIN pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as
        the clk-pin property's.

    clock-source:
      type: string
      default: "PCLK32M_HFXO"
      description: |
        Clock source to be used by the PDM peripheral. The following options
        are available:
        - "PCLK32M": 32 MHz peripheral clock, synchronous to HFCLK
        - "PCLK32M_HFXO": PCLK32M running off the 32 MHz crystal oscillator
          (HFXO) for better clock accuracy and jitter performance
        - "ACLK": Audio PLL clock with configurable frequency (frequency for
          this clock must be set via the "hfclkaudio-frequency" property
          in the "nordic,nrf-clock" node); this clock source is only available
          in the nRF53 Series SoCs and it requires the use of HFXO
      enum:
        - "PCLK32M"
        - "PCLK32M_HFXO"
        - "ACLK"

    queue-size:
      type: int
      default: 4
      description: |
        Size of the queue of received audio data blocks to be used
        by the driver.
