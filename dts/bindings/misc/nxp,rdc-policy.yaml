      Set the RDC permission for specified peripheral: Resource Domain Controller (RDC)
      supports flexible configuration on IPâ€™s access permission, each individual IP can,
      for example, be configured as A-core only or M-core only. This property uses some
      macros defined in 'include/zephyr/dt-bindings/rdc/imx_rdc.h' to configure current
      peripheral's access permission.
      For example to allow both A53 and M7 Core to have read/write permission to current
      peripheral:
      rdc = <(RDC_DOMAIN_PERM(A53_DOMAIN_ID, RDC_DOMAIN_PERM_RW)|\
              RDC_DOMAIN_PERM(M7_DOMAIN_ID, RDC_DOMAIN_PERM_RW))>;
