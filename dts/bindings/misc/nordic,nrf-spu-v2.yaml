        Array of index pairs that denote bus peripherals that should use a
        different ID on the same bus for configurations. The indices are
        represented as a pair of numbers:

          {periph_id_0, remapped_id_0, ..., periph_id_n, remapped_id_n}

        where each pair denotes that configuration for PERIPH.PERM[periph_id_n]
        should instead be written to PERIPH.PERM[remapped_id_n].
