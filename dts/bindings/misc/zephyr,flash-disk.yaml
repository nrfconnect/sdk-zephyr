description: Block storage device on flash partition

compatible: "zephyr,flash-disk"

include: base.yaml

properties:
    partition:
      type: phandle
      required: true
      description: |
        Backing storage flash map partition.

    disk-name:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |
        Disk name.

    sector-size:
      type: int
      default: 512
      description: |
        Emulated block device sector size in bytes.

    cache-size:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        Size of statically allocated buffer size in bytes. The size should be
        adequately chosen. On storage backends with uniform erase-blocks it
        should be at least the erase-block-size, on storage backends with
        non-uniform erase-blocks it should be at least the largest
        erase-block-size. The cache-size property is ignored if the partition
        is read-only.
