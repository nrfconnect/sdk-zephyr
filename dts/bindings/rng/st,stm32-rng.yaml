           This property is used to configure the RNG_CR for the NIST certification
           The validation conditions are following the refMan
           to certify NIST SP800-90B. RNG clock source must be 48MHz.
           This config is valid with some STM32 families
           and when Conditioning Soft Reset (RNG_CR_CONDRST bit) exists.
           The value is directly mapped from the RNG configuration (A) table.
           The Health Register (health-test-config property) must correspond
           to this table configuration.
           On the stm32U5, the ARDIS bit7 is also written.
