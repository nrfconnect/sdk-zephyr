  STM32 DMA controller

  The STM32 DMA is a general-purpose direct memory access controller
  capable of supporting 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 independent DMA channels.
  Each stm32 soc with a DMA is of a special version type, which could be
  V1 like stm32F4 or stm32F2 socs, they include FIFO control registers
  or V2 like stm32L4 soc or stm322WB, some also have DMAMUX controller
  or V2bis like stm32F1 or stm32L1, where requests are multiplexed

compatible: "st,stm32-dma"

include: dma-controller.yaml

properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    st,mem2mem:
      type: boolean

        offset in the table of channels when mapping to a DMAMUX
        for 1st dma instance, offset is 0,
        for 2nd dma instance, offset is the nb of dma channels of the 1st dma,
        for 3rd dma instance, offset is the nb of dma channels of the 2nd dma
        plus the nb of dma channels of the 1st dma instance, etc.
