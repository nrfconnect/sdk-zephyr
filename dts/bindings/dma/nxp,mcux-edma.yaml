# Parameter syntax of NXP follows the dmamux client dts syntax
# in the Linux kernel declared in
# https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/devicetree/devicetree-rebasing.git/tree/Bindings/dma/fsl-edma.txt
#
# - #dma-cells : Must be <2>.
#  The 1st cell specifies the DMAMUX(0 for DMAMUX0 and 1 for DMAMUX1).
#    Specific request source can only be multiplexed by specific channels
#    group called DMAMUX.
#  The 2nd cell specifies the request source(slot) ID.
#    See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.
# * DMA clients
# DMA client drivers that uses the DMA function must use the format described
# in the dma.txt file, using a two-cell specifier for each channel: the 1st
# specifies the channel group(DMAMUX) in which this request can be multiplexed,
# and the 2nd specifies the request source.

dma-cells:
  - mux
  - source
