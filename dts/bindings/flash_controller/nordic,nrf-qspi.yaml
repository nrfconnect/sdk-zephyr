    Properties defining the interface for the Nordic QSPI peripheral.

    The reg property describes two register blocks: one for the memory
    corresponding to the QSPI peripheral registers, and another for
    the memory mapped XIP area:

        qspi: qspi@2b000 {
                compatible = "nordic,nrf-qspi";
                reg = <0x2b000 0x1000>, <0x10000000 0x10000000>;
                reg-names = "qspi", "qspi_mm";
                ...
        };

    Above, the register block with base address 0x2b000 and name
    "qspi" are the QSPI peripheral registers. The register block with
    base address 0x10000000 and name "qspi_mm" is the XIP area.

      The SCK pin to use.

      For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
      to use P0.16 for SCK, set:

          sck-pin = <16>;

      For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
      example, to use P1.2 for SCK, set:

          sck-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */
  io-pins:
    type: array
    required: true

      Pin numbers associated with IO0 through IO3 signals.

      Examples:

          io-pins = <io0-pin io1-pin>; // two pins

          io-pins = <io0-pin io1-pin io2-pin io3-pin>; // four pins

      Either two or four pins must be configured using this property
      as shown above. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
      sck-pin property's.

      Chip select signal pin number. Exactly one pin should be
      given. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
      sck-pin property's.
