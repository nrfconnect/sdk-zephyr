description: NXP Synchronous Audio Interface (SAI) node

compatible: "nxp,dai-sai"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
  mclk-is-output:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Use this property to set the SAI MCLK as output or as input.
      By default, if this property is not specified, MCLK will be
      set as input. Setting the MCLK as output for SAIs which don't
      support MCLK configuration will result in a BUILD_ASSERT()
      failure.
  rx-fifo-watermark:
    type: int
    description: |
      Use this property to specify the watermark value for the TX
      FIFO. This value needs to be in FIFO words (NOT BYTES). This
      value needs to be in the following interval: (0, DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH],
      otherwise a BUILD_ASSERT() failure will be raised.
  tx-fifo-watermark:
    type: int
    description: |
      Use this property to specify the watermark value for the RX
      FIFO. This value needs to be in FIFO words (NOT BYTES). This
      value needs to be in the following interval: (0, DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH],
      otherwise a BUILD_ASSERT() failure will be raised.
  interrupts:
    required: true
  fifo-depth:
    type: int
    description: |
      Use this property to set the FIFO depth that will be reported
      to other applications calling dai_get_properties(). This value
      should be in the following interval: (0, DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH],
      otherwise a BUILD_ASSERT() failure will be raised.
      By DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH we mean the actual (hardware) value of
      the FIFO depth. This is needed because some applications (e.g: SOF)
      use this value to compute the DMA burst size, in which case
      DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH cannot be used. Generally, reporting a false
      FIFO depth should be avoided. Please note that the sanity check
      for tx/rx-fifo-watermark uses DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH instead of this
      value so use with caution. If unsure, it's better to simply not
      use this property, in which case the reported value will be
      DEFAULT_FIFO_DEPTH.
  dai-index:
    type: int
    description: |
      Use this property to specify the index of the DAI. At the
      moment, this is only used by SOF to fetch the "struct device"
      associated with the DAI whose index Linux passes to SOF
      through an IPC. If this property is not specified, the DAI
      index will be considered 0.
  tx-sync-mode:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
    description: |
      Use this property to specify which synchronization mode to use
      for the transmitter. At the moment, the only supported modes are:
        1) The transmitter is ASYNC (0)
        2) The transmitter is in SYNC with the receiver (1)
      If this property is not specified, the transmitter will be set to ASYNC.
      If one side is SYNC then the other MUST be ASYNC. Failing to meet this
      condition will result in a failed BUILD_ASSERT().
  rx-sync-mode:
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
