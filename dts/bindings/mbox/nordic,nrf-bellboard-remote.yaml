  Nordic BELLBOARD

  BELLBOARD provides support for inter-domain software signaling. It implements
  a set of tasks and events intended for signaling within an interprocessor
  communication (IPC) framework. When used in remote mode, the BELLBOARD
  instance is used to trigger events to another core.

  Example definition:

    bellboard: mailbox@deadbeef {
      compatible = "nordic,nrf-bellboard-remote";
      reg = <0xdeadbeef 0x1000>;
      #mbox-cells = <1>;
    };

compatible: "nordic,nrf-bellboard-remote"

include: "nordic,nrf-bellboard-common.yaml"
