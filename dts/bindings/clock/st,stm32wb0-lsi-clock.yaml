  STM32WB0 LSI Clock

  The STM32WB0 MCUs are equipped with a regular RC LSI clock with a frequency of 24~40kHz.
  The SoCs are also equipped with hardware to perform LSI frequency measurement, which
  allows to adapt all frequency-based calculations to a somewhat accurate value, ensuring
  that the software does not get too much out of sync with real-world time.

  Several LSI frequency measurement options can be configured via Kconfig.
