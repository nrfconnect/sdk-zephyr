  Main PLL node binding for low-, medium-, high- and XL-density STM32F1 devices.

  Takes one of 'clk_hse', 'clk_hse / 2' (when 'xtpre' is set) or 'clk_hsi / 2'
  as input clock.

  Up to 2 output clocks could be supported and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formula:

    f(PLLCLK) = f(input clk) x PLLMUL  --> SYSCLK (System Clock)
    f(USBCLK) = f(PLLCLK) / USBPRE     --> USB

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed 72 MHz.
