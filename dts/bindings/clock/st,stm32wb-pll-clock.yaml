  STM32WB and STM32WL PLL node.

  It can be used to describe 2 different PLLs: PLL, PLLSAI1.
  Only main PLL is supported for now.

  These PLLs could take one of clk_hse, clk_hsi or clk_msi as input clock, with
  an input frequency from 2.66 to 16 MHz. PLLM factor is used to set the input
  clock in this acceptable range.

  Each PLL can have up to 3 output clocks and for each output clock, the
  frequency can be computed with the following formulae:

    f(PLL_P) = f(VCO clock) / PLLP  --> PLLPCLK
    f(PLL_Q) = f(VCO clock) / PLLQ  --> PLLQCLK
    f(PLL_R) = f(VCO clock) / PLLR  --> PLLRCLK (System Clock)

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) Ã— (PLLN / PLLM)

  The PLL output frequency must not exceed:
          - 64 MHz on STM32WB
          - 62 MHz on STM32WL
