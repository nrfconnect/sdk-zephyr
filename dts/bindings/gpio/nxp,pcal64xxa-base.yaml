      GPIO connected to the controller INT pin. This pin is active-low.

      GPIO connected to the controller RESET pin. This pin is active-low.

  no-auto-reset:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This flag disables the automatic reset, which allows the implementation
      of for instance an external state retention of the port expander. If
      this flag is set it must be ensured that for an actually uninitialized
      port expander the manual reset is triggered via the exposed reset
      function, specific to the PCAL64XXA.
