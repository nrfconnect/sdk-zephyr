      GPIO to use to enable/disable the regulator.

      Unlike the gpio property in the Linux bindings this array must
      provide the GPIO polarity and open-drain status in the phandle
      selector.  The Linux enable-active-high and gpio-open-drain
      properties are not valid for Zephyr devicetree files.
