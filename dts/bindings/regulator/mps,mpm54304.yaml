  Monolithic Power Systems MPM54304 quad-output DC/DC step-down power module.
  See https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mpm54304.html.

  The MPM54304 has four buck regulators. All need to be defined as
  children nodes, strictly following the BUCK1..4 node names. For
  example:

  mpm54304@68 {
    reg = <0x68>;
    ...

    BUCK1 {
      /* all properties for BUCK1 */
    };
    BUCK2 {
      /* all properties for BUCK2 */
    };
    BUCK3 {
      /* all properties for BUCK3 */
    };
    BUCK4 {
      /* all properties for BUCK4 */
    };
  };
