  nxp,swap-bytes:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Swap bytes while transferring on LCDIC. When set, the LCDIC will send
      the most significant byte first when using multibyte pixel formats.

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Reset GPIO pin. The controller will set this pin to logic high to reset
      the display. If not provided, the LCDIC module's reset pin will be used
      to reset attached displays.

  nxp,write-inactive-cycles:
    type: int
    default: 6
    description: |
      Set minimum count of write inactive cycles, as a multiple of the module
      clock frequency. This controls the length of the inactive period of the
      WRX signal. Default is IP reset value. Only valid in 8080 mode.

    type: int
    default: 6
