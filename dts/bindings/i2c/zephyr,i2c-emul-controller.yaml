compatible: "zephyr,i2c-emul-controller"

include: i2c-controller.yaml

properties:
  reg:
    required: true
  target-buffered-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This option is used when the I2C target is enabled and it can support
      buffered mode for I2C target transfer. When 'false', the target will use
      PIO (Programmed I/O) mode.
  forwards:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      When added, read/write requests sent to this bus for a given address will
      be forwarded to the specified phandle (must be another i2c bus). As an
      example, if we wanted to forward any requests from i2c0@0x20 to i2c1, we
      would use:

      &i2c0 {
        forward = <&i2c1 0x20>;
      };

forward-cells:
  - addr
