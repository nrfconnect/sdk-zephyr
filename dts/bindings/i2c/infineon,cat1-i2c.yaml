      PORT pin configuration for SCL, SDA signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and have following
      format: p<port>_<pin><peripheral inst>_<signal>.

      Examples:
        pinctrl-0 = <&p6_0_scb3_i2c_scl &p6_1_scb3_i2c_sda>;
