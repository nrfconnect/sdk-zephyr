      description: |
        This option is used to configure the I2C speed prescaler for
        the SCL low period. When set to >= 1, it will increase the
        low period of the SCL clock and so reduce the signal frequency.
        The resulting SCL cycle time is given by the following formula:
        SCL cycle = 2 * (psr + prescale_tweak + 2) *
                    SMBus clock cycle
