    # If enabled, overflow different than full range (24 bits) is handled
    # through PPI channel which ensures precise timing. If disabled then
    # counter is cleared in the interrupt which results in accumulative error
    # of counter period if top value is different than maximal.

   # If enabled then counter based on nRF RTC peripheral supports only maximal
   # top value. That results in code optimizations and availability of one more
