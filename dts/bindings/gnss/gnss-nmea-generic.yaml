  Generic GNSS NMEA receiver

  Implement a generic NMEA based GNSS device.

  Example configuration:

  &uart0 {
          current-speed = <9600>;
          ...
          gnss: gnss-nmea-generic {
                  compatible = "gnss-nmea-generic";
          };
  };

compatible: "gnss-nmea-generic"

include:
  - uart-device.yaml

properties:
  nmea-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    default: 500
    description: |
      Synchronization timeout for NMEA sentences. The NMEA parser is expecting
      to receive a GGA and RMC sentences within this time frame to publish a
      location data. Set accordingly to the UART datarate and location
      reporting frequency. Defaults to 500ms if unspecified.
