description: Generic NOR flash on MSPI bus

compatible: "jedec,mspi-nor"

include: [mspi-device.yaml, "jedec,spi-nor-common.yaml"]

properties:
  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      RESET line. If specified, the flash chip will be reset at initialization.

  t-reset-pulse:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum duration, in nanoseconds, of an active pulse on the RESET line.

  t-reset-recovery:
    type: int
    description: |
      Minimum time, in nanoseconds, the flash chip needs to recover after reset.

  transfer-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Maximum time, in milliseconds, allowed for a single transfer on the MSPI
      bus in communication with the flash chip. The default value is the one
      that was previously hard-coded in the flash_mspi_nor driver.

  use-4byte-addressing:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates that 4-byte addressing is to be used in communication with
      the flash chip. The driver will use dedicated instruction codes for
      commands that require addresses (like Read, Page Program, or Erase)
      and will switch the flash chip to 4-byte addressing mode if necessary.
