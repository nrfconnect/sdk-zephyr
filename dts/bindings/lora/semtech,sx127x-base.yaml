    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to the modem's RESET/NRESET signal.

        This signal is open-drain, active-high (SX1272/3) or
        active-low (SX1276/7/8/9) as interpreted by the modem.

    dio-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        Up to six pins that produce service interrupts from the modem.

        These signals are normally active-high.

    power-amplifier-output:
      type: string
      description: |
        Selects power amplifier output pin. This is required when neither
        'rfo-enable-gpios' nor 'pa-boost-enable-gpios' is specified. In other
        case this property is simply ignored.
      enum:
         - "rfo"
         - "pa-boost"
