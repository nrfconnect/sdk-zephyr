    host-io:
      type: int
      description: |
        Logical device Host I/O (x86) base. Refer to SoC documentation for the
        number of I/O decoders implemented by a device (1 or 2) and the fixed
        I/O masks.

    host-io-addr-mask:
      type: int
      description: |
        Host I/O address mask. This value is fixed for all HW and is only
        used by Port80 BIOS debug alias device to specify the byte lane the
        alias address is mapped to in the 80h to 83h I/O range.

    host-mem:
      type: int
      description: |
        Logical device Host memory (x86) base address. Refer to SoC
        documentation for which logical devices implement a memory decoder
        and the fixed memory address masking.

    emi-mems:
      type: array
      description: |
        Each EMI host device supports Host access to two SoC data memory
        regions. Each region requires three configuration parameters:
        Base address in the SoC data memory, read limit, and write limit.
        If bits[14:2] of the address written by the Host to the EC address
        register is less than the limit value the access is allowed. Bit[15]
        of the EC address selects which of the two memory regions is accessed.
