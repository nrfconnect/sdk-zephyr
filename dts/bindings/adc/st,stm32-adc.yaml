  vref-mv:
    type: int
    default: 3300
    description: Indicates the reference voltage of the ADC in mV (on the target board).

  temp-channel:
    type: int
    description: Indicates the ADC channel of the internal temperature sensor.

  vref-channel:
    type: int
    description: Indicates the ADC channel of the internal voltage reference.

  vbat-channel:
    type: int
    description: Indicates the ADC channel of the internal vbat monitoring.

  resolutions:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      List of the resolutions supported by the ADC instance. They should be
      values created with STM32_ADC_RES macro or similar. Their order is not
      important. For example for STM32F4:
        <STM32_ADC_RES(12, 0x00) STM32_ADC_RES(10, 0x01)
         STM32_ADC_RES(8, 0x02)  STM32_ADC_RES(6, 0x03)>
      The two parameters are the resolution (for example 10 bits) and the
      corresponding register value (0x01 for a 10-bit resolution).
      By design, these macros also contains all register information (address,
      field offset and field mask) necessary to properly set the resolution.

  sampling-times:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      List all the sampling times supported by the ADC instance.
      Rounded up if needed. Order is important: their index matches their binary
      value in the register.

  num-sampling-time-common-channels:
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of sampling time common channels for this ADC instance, if any.

  - input
