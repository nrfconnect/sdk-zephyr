description: GigaDevice GD32 ADC

# gd32 adc irq have some special cases as below:
#   1. adc number no larger than 3.
#   2. adc0 and adc1 share the same irq number.
#   3. For gd32f4xx, adc2 share the same irq number with adc0 and adc1.
#
# To cover this cases, adc_gd32 driver use node-label 'adc0', 'adc1' and
# 'adc2' to handle gd32 adc irq config directly.
#
# Sorry for the restriction, But new added gd32 adc node-label must be 'adc0',
# 'adc1' and 'adc2'.
