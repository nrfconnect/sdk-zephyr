HT16K33 LED driver with keyscan
###############################

Overview
********

This sample controls the LEDs connected to a `Holtek HT16K33`_
driver. The sample supports up to 128 LEDs connected to the
rows/columns of the HT16K33.

The LEDs are controlled using the following pattern:

 1. turn on all connected (up to 128) LEDs one-by-one
 2. blink the LEDs at 2 Hz, 1 Hz, and 0.5 Hz
 3. reduce the brightness gradually from 100% to 0%
 4. turn off all LEDs, restore 100% brightness, and start over

The sample logs keyscan events on the console.
