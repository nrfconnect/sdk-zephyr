Bluetooth: ST BLE Sensor Demo
#############################

Overview
********

This application demonstrates BLE peripheral by exposing vendor-specific
GATT services. Currently only button notification and LED service are
implemented. Other BLE sensor services can easily be added.
See `BlueST protocol`_ document for details of how to add a new service.

Requirements
************

* `ST BLE Sensor Android app <ST BLE Sensor app>`_
* A board with BLE support

Building and Running
********************

This sample can be found under :zephyr_file:`samples/bluetooth/st_ble_sensor` in the
Zephyr tree.
