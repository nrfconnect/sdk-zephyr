Bluetooth: Multiple Broadcaster
###############################

Overview
********

A simple application demonstrating the Bluetooth Low Energy Broadcaster that
uses multiple advertising sets functionality.

This sample advertises two non-connectable non-scannable advertising sets with
two different SID. Number of advertising sets can be increased by updating the
`CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV_MAX_ADV_SET` value in the project configuration file.

When building this sample combined with a Bluetooth LE Controller, the
advertising data length can be increased from the default 31 bytes by updating
the Controller's `CONFIG_BT_CTLR_ADV_DATA_LEN_MAX` value. The size of the
manufacturer data is calculated to maximize the use of supported AD data length.

Requirements
************

* A board with Bluetooth Low Energy with Extended Advertising support.

Building and Running
