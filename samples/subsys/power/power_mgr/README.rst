OS Power management demo
###########################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates OS managed power saving mechanism through the sample
application which will periodically go sleep there by invoking the idle thread
which will call the sys_suspend() to enter into low power states. The Low
Power state will be selected based on the next timeout event.

Requirements
************

This application uses nrf52 DK board for the demo.

Building, Flashing and Running
******************************

.. zephyr-app-commands::

Running:

1. Open UART terminal.
2. Power Cycle Device.
3. Device will enter into Low Power Modes periodically.
