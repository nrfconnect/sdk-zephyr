/*
 * NVS Sample for Zephyr using high level API, the sample illustrates the usage
 * of NVS for storing data of different kind (strings, binary blobs, unsigned
 * 32 bit integer) and also how to read them back from flash. The reading of
 * data is illustrated for both a basic read (latest added value) as well as
 * reading back the history of data (previously added values). Next to reading
 * and writing data it also shows how data can be deleted from flash.
 *
 * The sample stores the following items:
 * 1. A string representing an IP-address: stored at id=1, data="192.168.1.1"
 * 2. A binary blob representing a key: stored at id=2, data=FF FE FD FC FB FA
 *    F9 F8
 * 3. A reboot counter (32bit): stored at id=3, data=reboot_counter
 * 4. A string: stored at id=4, data="DATA" (used to illustrate deletion of
 * items)
 *
 * At first boot the sample checks if the data is available in flash and adds
 * the items if they are not in flash.
 *
 * Every reboot increases the values of the reboot_counter and updates it in
 * flash.
 *
 * At the 10th reboot the string item with id=4 is deleted (or marked for
 * deletion).
 *
 * At the 11th reboot the istring tem with id=4 can no longer be read with the
 * basic nvs_read() function as it has been deleted. It is possible to read the
 * value with nvs_read_hist()
 *
 * At the 78th reboot the first sector is full and a new sector is taken into
 * use. The data with id=1, id=2 and id=3 is copied to the new sector. As a
 * result of this the history of the reboot_counter will be removed but the
 * latest values of address, key and reboot_counter is kept.
