USB Mass Storage Sample Application
###################################

Overview
********

This sample app demonstrates use of a USB Mass Storage driver by the Zephyr
project.  This very simple driver enumerates a board with either RAM or FLASH
into an USB disk.  This sample can be found under
:zephyr_file:`samples/subsys/usb/mass` in the Zephyr project tree.

Requirements
************

This project requires a USB device driver, and either 16KiB of RAM or a FLASH
device.

Building and Running
********************

This sample can be built for multiple boards. The selection between a RAM-based
or a FLASH-based disk can be selected using the ``overlay-ram-disk.conf`` or
the ``overlay-flash-disk.conf`` overlays.  In this example we will build the sample
with a RAM-based disk and for the quark_se_c1000_devboard board:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/subsys/usb/mass
   :board: quark_se_c1000_devboard
   :gen-args: -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-ram-disk.conf"
   :goals: build
   :compact:

After you have built and flashed the sample app image to your board, plug the
board into a host device, for example, a PC running Linux.
The board will be detected as shown by the Linux journalctl command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ journalctl -k -n 17

The disk contains a simple ``README.TXT`` file with the following content:

    This is a  RAM Disk based  USB Mass Storage demo for Zephyr.

Files can be added or removed like with a simple USB disk, of course within
the 16KiB limit.
