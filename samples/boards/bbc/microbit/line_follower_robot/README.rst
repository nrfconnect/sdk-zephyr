   :name: Line following robot

   Implement a line following robot using a BBC micro:bit board and robot chassis.

Overview
********

This sample controls a stand-alone line-following DFRobot Maqueen
robot chassis containing a BBC micro:bit board.

Requirements
************

To build and run this sample you'll need a `DFRobot Maqueen robot
chassis (ROB0148) <https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1783.html>`_
with a BBC micro:bit board. Use black tape to create a line track
for the robot to follow. Build and flash the program to the BBC
micro:bit board (described below), turn on the robot,
and put it on the black line track.
