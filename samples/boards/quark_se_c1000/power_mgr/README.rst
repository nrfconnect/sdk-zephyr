Intel® Quark™ SE Microcontroller C1000 Power management demo
############################################################

Overview
********

A sample implementation of a power manager app that uses the Zephyr
power management infrastructure.

This app will cycle through the various power schemes at every call
to _sys_soc_suspend() hook function.
It will cycle through the following states:

1. CPU Low Power State

2. Deep Sleep - demonstrates invoking suspend/resume handlers of
   devices to save device states and switching to deep sleep state.

3. No-op - no operation and letting kernel do its idle

Requirements
************

This application uses an Intel® Quark™ SE Microcontroller C1000 board for
the demo. It demonstrates power operations on the x86 and ARC cores in
the board.

.. note::

  PM support on Intel Quark SE Microcontroller C1000 board requires
  the latest version of the `boot loader
  <https://github.com/quark-mcu/qm-bootloader/releases>`_.
