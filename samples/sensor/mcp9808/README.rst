MCP9808 Temperature Sensor
##########################

Overview
********

This sample application periodically (0.5 Hz) measures the ambient
temperature. The result is written to the console.

If triggered measurements are enabled the sample initializes and
maintains a |plusminus| 2 |deg| C window around the current temperature.
When the temperature moves outside the window an alert is given, and the
window is moved to center on the new temperature.

Requirements
************

The MCP9808 digital temperature sensor converts temperatures between -20 |deg|
C and +100 |deg| C to a digital word with |plusminus| 0.5 |deg| C (max.)
accuracy. It is I2C compatible and supports up to 16 devices on the bus.

Wiring
*******

The MCP9808 is available in a discrete component form but it is much easier to
use it mounted on a breakout board.  We used the Adafruit `MCP9808
Sensor`_ breakout board.

Building and Running
********************

After providing a devicetree overlay that specifies the sensor I2C bus
and alert GPIO, build this sample app using:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/sensor/mcp9808
   :board: particle_xenon
   :goals: build flash

Sample Output
=============

Note that in the capture below output from the trigger callback and the
main thread are interleaved.
