   :name: INA219 Bidirectional Power/Current Monitor
   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Get shunt voltage, bus voltage, power and current from an INA219 sensor.

Overview
********

This sample application measures shunt voltage, bus voltage, power and current
every 2 seconds and prints them to console.
The calibration/configuration parameters can be set in the devicetree file.

Wiring
******

The supply voltage of the INA219 can be in the 3V to 5.5V range.
The common mode voltage of the measured bus can be in the 0V to 26V range.

Sample Output
=============
When monitoring a 3.3 V bus with a 0.1 Ohm shunt resistor
you should get a similar output as below, repeated every 2 seconds:

.. code-block:: console

        Shunt: 0.001570 [V] -- Bus: 3.224000 [V] -- Power: 0.504000 [W] -- Current: 0.157000 [A]


A negative sign indicates current flowing in reverse direction:

.. code-block:: console

        Shunt: -0.001560 [V] -- Bus: 3.224000 [V] -- Power: 0.502000 [W] -- Current: -0.156000 [A]
