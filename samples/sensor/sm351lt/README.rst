   :name: SM351LT Magnetoresistive Sensor
   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Detect a magnet's presence using the SM351LT magnetoresistive sensor (polling & trigger mode).

Overview
********

This sample application periodically polls an SM351LT magnetoresistive sensor
and displays if a magnet near to the sensor, via the console.

Requirements
************

This sample uses the Honeywell SM351LT sensor.
