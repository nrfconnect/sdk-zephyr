.. zephyr:code-sample:: adc_cmp_npcx
   :name: NPCX ADC Comparator
   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Detect upper/lower voltage limits using NPCX ADC Comparator driver.

Overview
********

This sample show how to use the NPCX ADC Comparator driver. The
sample supports the :ref:`npcx9m6f_evb`.

This application is a voltage comparator with hysteresis, upper limit is
set at 1 V while lower limit is 250 mV. Initially configured to detect
upper limit.

Building and Running
********************

Build the application for the :ref:`npcx9m6f_evb` board, and provide voltage
to ADC channel 8, when voltages cross upper/lower limits, detection messages
will be printed.
