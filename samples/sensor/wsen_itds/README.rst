WSEN-ITDS: 3-axis acceleration sensor
#####################################

Overview
********
 This sample periodically measures acceleration in 3-axis and die temperature for
 5 sec in the interval of 300msec in polling mode. Then data ready trigger mode
 is enabled with the sample frequency of 400Hz and 3-axis data is fetched based
 on interrupt. The result is displayed on the console.

Requirements
************

 This sample uses the WSEN-ITDS sensor controlled using the I2C interface.
 Connect sensor IN1 for interrupt(data ready trigger) to Disco board D8 pin
 Connect sensor CS pin high to enable I2C communication, SAO to ground for 0x18
 I2C address selection.

Building and Running
********************

 This project outputs sensor data to the console. It requires a WSEN-ITDS
 sensor, which is present on the disco_l475_iot1 board.
