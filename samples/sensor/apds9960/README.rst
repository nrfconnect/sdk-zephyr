   :name: APDS9960 RGB, ambient light, and gesture sensor
   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Get ambient light, RGB, and proximity/gesture data from an APDS9960 sensor.

Overview
********

This sample application demonstrates how to use the APDS9960 sensor to get
ambient light, RGB, and proximity (or gesture) data.  This sample checks the
sensor in polling mode (without an interrupt trigger).

Building and Running
********************

This sample application uses an APDS9960 sensor connected to a board
(for example as shown in this
`Sparkfun APDS9960 tutorial`_).
