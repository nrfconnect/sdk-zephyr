   :relevant-api: sensor_interface

   Get temperature from a MAX6675 K-thermocouple to digital converter (polling
   mode).

Overview
********

This is a sample application to read an external MAX6675
cold-junction-compensated K-thermocouple to digital converter.

Requirements
************

- MAX6675 wired to your board SPI bus
- K-thermocouple connected to MAX6675 T+/T- inputs

Building and Running
********************

This sample can be built with any board that supports SPI. A sample overlay is
provided for the NUCLEO-F030R8 board.

Sample Output
=============

The application will read and print sensor temperature every second. Note that
temperature fetch will fail if the K-thermocouple is not connected. This is
because MAX6675 is able to detect if the K-thermocouple is connected or not.
