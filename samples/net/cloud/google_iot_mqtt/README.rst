Building and Running
********************
This application has been built and tested on the NXP FRDMK64F.  RSA or
ECDSA certs/keys are required to authenticate to the Google IOT Cloud.
The application includes a key creation script.

Run the ``create_keys.py`` script in the
``samples/net/cloud/google_iot_mqtt/src/private_info/`` directory.

Users will also be required to configure the following Kconfig options
based on their Google Cloud IOT project:

- CLOUD_CLIENT_ID - created from <telemetry>/<region>/registries/<registry name>/devices/<device name>
- CLOUD_AUDIENCE - created from telemetry without projects on front
- CLOUD_SUBSCRIBE_CONFIG - created from /devices/<device name>/config
- CLOUD_PUBLISH_TOPIC - created from /devices/<device name>/state
