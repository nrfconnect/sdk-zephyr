# This sample application will have three network interfaces.
# gPTP protocol will run in the non-VLAN interface and then there
# will be two VLAN interface for other use. This is just an example
# how to do this kind of setup. See also VLAN sample application
# for vlan-setup-linux.sh script that can be used to setup the
# VLAN IP addressing in Linux side (if that is desired).
