   :name: Samples and Demos

Zephyr offers a comprehensive collection of samples and demos that highlight the features of the
kernel and its subsystems.

These samples are crafted to be simple and easy to understand, serving as a starting point for your
own projects.

We welcome contributions of new samples to the project and you are encouraged to read more about
the :ref:`definition_and_criteria` if you are interested in submitting your own sample.
