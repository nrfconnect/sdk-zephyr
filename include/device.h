 * @def DEVICE_INIT
 *
 * @brief Create device object and set it up for boot time initialization.
 *
 * @details This macro defines a device object that is automatically
 * configured by the kernel during system initialization.
 *
 * @param dev_name Device name. This must be less than Z_DEVICE_MAX_NAME_LEN
 * characters in order to be looked up from user mode with device_get_binding().
 *
 * @param drv_name The name this instance of the driver exposes to
 * the system.
 *
 * @param init_fn Address to the init function of the driver.
 *
 * @param data Pointer to the device's configuration data.
 *
 * @param cfg_info The address to the structure containing the
 * configuration information for this instance of the driver.
 *
 * @param level The initialization level at which configuration occurs.
 * Must be one of the following symbols, which are listed in the order
 * they are performed by the kernel:
 * \n
 * \li PRE_KERNEL_1: Used for devices that have no dependencies, such as those
 * that rely solely on hardware present in the processor/SOC. These devices
 * cannot use any kernel services during configuration, since they are not
 * yet available.
 * \n
 * \li PRE_KERNEL_2: Used for devices that rely on the initialization of devices
 * initialized as part of the PRIMARY level. These devices cannot use any
 * kernel services during configuration, since they are not yet available.
 * \n
 * \li POST_KERNEL: Used for devices that require kernel services during
 * configuration.
 * \n
 * \li APPLICATION: Used for application components (i.e. non-kernel components)
 * that need automatic configuration. These devices can use all services
 * provided by the kernel during configuration.
 *
 * @param prio The initialization priority of the device, relative to
 * other devices of the same initialization level. Specified as an integer
 * value in the range 0 to 99; lower values indicate earlier initialization.
 * Must be a decimal integer literal without leading zeroes or sign (e.g. 32),
 * or an equivalent symbolic name (e.g. \#define MY_INIT_PRIO 32); symbolic
 * expressions are *not* permitted
 * (e.g. CONFIG_KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEFAULT + 5).
