/**
 * Map a physical memory region into the kernel's virtual address space
 *
 * This function is intended for mapping memory-mapped I/O regions into
 * the virtual address space. Given a physical address and a size, return a
 * linear address representing the base of where the physical region is mapped
 * in the virtual address space for the Zephyr kernel.
 *
 * This function alters the active page tables in the area reserved
 * for the kernel. This function will choose the virtual address
 * and return it to the caller.
 *
 * Portable code should never assume that phys_addr and linear_addr will
 * be equal.
 *
 * Caching and access properties are controlled by the 'flags' parameter.
 * Unused bits in 'flags' are reserved for future expansion.
 * A caching mode must be selected. By default, the region is read-only
 * with user access and code execution forbidden. This policy is changed
 * by passing K_MEM_CACHE_* and K_MEM_PERM_* macros into the 'flags' parameter.
 *
 * If there is insufficient virtual address space for the mapping this will
 * generate a kernel panic.
 *
 * This API is only available if CONFIG_MMU is enabled.
 *
 * It is highly discouraged to use this function to map system RAM page
 * frames. It may conflict with anonymous memory mappings and demand paging
 * and produce undefined behavior.  Do not use this for RAM unless you know
 * exactly what you are doing. If you need a chunk of memory, use k_mem_map().
 * If you need a contiguous buffer of physical memory, statically declare it
 * and pin it at build time, it will be mapped when the system boots.
 *
 * This API is part of infrastructure still under development and may
 * change.
 *
 * @param[out] virt Output virtual address storage location
 * @param[in]  phys Physical address base of the memory region
 * @param[in]  size Size of the memory region
 * @param[in]  flags Caching mode and access flags, see K_MAP_* macros
