 * @brief Extended sensor channel for TDK MEMS supportintg APEX features
 *
 * This exposes sensor channel for the TDK MEMS which can be used for
 * getting the APEX features data.
 *
 * The APEX (Advanced Pedometer and Event Detection â€“ neXt gen) features of
 * TDK MEMS consist of:
 * ** Pedometer: Tracks step count.
 * ** Tilt Detection: Detect the Tilt angle exceeds 35 degrees.
 * ** Wake on Motion (WoM): Detects motion when accelerometer samples exceed
 * a programmable threshold. This motion event can be used to enable device
 * operation from sleep mode.
 * ** Significant Motion Detector (SMD): Detects significant motion based on
 * accelerometer data.
