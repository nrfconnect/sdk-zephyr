config MGMT_VERBOSE_ERR_RESPONSE
	bool "Support verbose error response"
	help
	  Support for encoding "rc" code explanation in form of "rsn"
	  text string.  This is useful, when returning MGMT_ERR_EUNKNOWN,
	  to add additional information on the source of an error.
	  Note that the "rsn" is string additional to "rc" code,
	  so MCUMGR_BUF_SIZE should be large enough to be able to encode
	  both.
