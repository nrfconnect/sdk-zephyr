	  This can be either IPv4 or IPv6 address.

	help
	  As each syslog message needs to fit to UDP packet, set this value
	  so that messages are not truncated.
	  The RFC 5426 recommends that for IPv4 the size is 480 octets and for
	  IPv6 the size is 1180 octets. As each buffer will use RAM, the value
	  should be selected so that typical messages will fit the buffer.

	  When enabled automatically start the networking backend on
	  application start. If no routes to the logging server are available
	  on application startup, this must be set to n and the backend must be
	  started by the application later on. Otherwise the logging
	  thread might block.
