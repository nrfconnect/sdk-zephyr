config WIFI_MGMT_RAW_SCAN_RESULTS
	bool "Raw scan results"
	help
	  This option enables raw scan results. When enabled, the raw scan
	  results (beacons or probe responses) are provided to the application.
	  Enabling this config will increase the net_mgmt event size
	  considerably.

config WIFI_MGMT_RAW_SCAN_RESULT_LENGTH

	default 512
	help
	  This option defines the maximum length of raw scan results.

config WIFI_MGMT_RAW_SCAN_RESULTS_ONLY
	bool "Only raw scan results"
	help
	  This option enables only raw scan results. When enabled, the raw scan
	  results (beacons or probe responses) are provided to the application.
	  The scan results are not parsed and the application is responsible
	  for parsing the scan results. Normal scan results are not provided
	  to the application.

config WIFI_MGMT_TWT_CHECK_IP
	bool "Check IP Assignment for TWT"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables check for valid IP address before TWT setup.
	  If TWT setup is triggered early in the connection, then device might
	  enter deep sleep without having a valid IP, this can result in device
	  being unreachable (IP Level) or unable to receive down link traffic
	  even when it is awake intervals. Rejecting TWT setup till Wi-Fi
	  interface has a valid IP address might be desirable in most scenarios.

config WIFI_MGMT_FORCED_PASSIVE_SCAN
	bool "Force Passive scan"
	help
	  Force passive scan (typically used to reduce power consumption),
	  the scan type is always sent as passive.
	  This doesn't guarantee that passive scan will be used, it depends
	  on the underlying chip implementation to support and honour scan type.
