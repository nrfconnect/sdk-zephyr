	  Maximum number of DHCPv4 server instances supported by the system.
	  Each network interface that wants to act as a DHCPv4 server requires
	  a separate instance.

	int "Number of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned by the server"
	default 4
	help
	  Maximum number of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned by the DHCPv4
	  server instance. The base IPv4 address in the address pool is provided
	  at runtime, during server initialization. Consecutive addresses in the
	  pool have the lowest address octet incremented.

config NET_DHCPV4_SERVER_ADDR_LEASE_TIME
	int "Lease time for IPv4 addresses assigned by the server (seconds)"
	default 86400
	help
	  Lease time in seconds for IPv4 addresses assigned by the server.
	  The lease time determines when the IPv4 address lease expires if the
	  client does not renew it.
