	help
	  If you enable this option, various IPSO objects supported below
	  will optionally include timestamp resources (ID 5518).
	  This is an LWM2M protocol extension which can be useful to associate
	  times with events. If unsure, leave at the default n.

config LWM2M_IPSO_TEMP_SENSOR
	bool "IPSO Temperature Sensor Support"
	help
	  This IPSO object should be used with a temperature sensor to
	  report a temperature measurement. It also provides resources for
