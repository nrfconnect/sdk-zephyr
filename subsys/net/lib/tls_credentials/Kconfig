	  Allows clients of the socket APIs to specify filenames
	  of security certificates and private keys
	  to use during subsequent TLS/SSL negotiations.
	  The secure files will have been previously provisioned to the
	  device's secure file system; eg, via a vendor tool or
	  by executing a separate binary.
	  This option is currently only available for secure
	  socket offload devices.
