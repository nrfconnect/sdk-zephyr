config NET_APP_AUTO_INIT
	bool "Init networking support automatically during device startup"
	default y
	help
	  If this option is set, then the net_app API is automatically
	  initialized when the device is started. If you do not wish to do
	  this, then disable this and call net_app_init() in your application.

config NET_APP_INIT_PRIO
	int "Startup priority for the network application init"
	default 95
	depends on NET_APP_AUTO_INIT

config NET_APP_INIT_TIMEOUT
	int "How long to wait for networking to be ready and available"
	default 30
	depends on NET_APP_AUTO_INIT
	help
	  The value is in seconds. If for example IPv4 address from DHCPv4 is not
	  received within this limit, then the net_app_init() call will fail
	  during the device startup.

config NET_APP_NEED_IPV6
	bool "This application wants IPv6 support"
	depends on NET_APP_AUTO_INIT
	select NET_IPV6
	help
	  The network application needs IPv6 support to function properly.
	  This option makes sure the network application is initialized properly
	  in order to use IPv6.

config NET_APP_NEED_IPV6_ROUTER
	bool "This application wants IPv6 router to exists"
	depends on NET_APP_AUTO_INIT
	depends on NET_IPV6
	help
	  The network application needs IPv6 router to exists before continuing.
	  What this means that the application wants to wait until it receives
	  IPv6 router advertisement message before continuing.

config NET_APP_NEED_IPV4
	bool "This application wants IPv4 support"
	depends on NET_APP_AUTO_INIT
	select NET_IPV4
	help
	  The network application needs IPv4 support to function properly.
	  This option makes sure the network application is initialized properly
	  in order to use IPv4.

config NET_DEBUG_CONFIG
	bool "Debug net config library"
	default y if NET_LOG_GLOBAL
	help
	  Enables net config library to output debug messages

menuconfig NET_APP_SETTINGS
	bool "Set network settings for applications"
	depends on NET_APP
	select NET_MGMT
	select NET_MGMT_EVENT
	help
	  Allow IP addresses to be set in config file for
	  networking client/server sample applications, or
	  some link-layer dedicated settings like the channel.
	  Beware this is not meant to be used for proper
	  provisioning but quick sampling/testing.
