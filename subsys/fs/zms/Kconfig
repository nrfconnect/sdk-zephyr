	  Enable support of Zephyr Memory Storage.

config ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	bool "ZMS lookup cache"
	help
	  Enable ZMS cache to reduce the ZMS data lookup time.
	  Each cache entry holds an address of the most recent allocation
	  table entry (ATE) for all ZMS IDs that fall into that cache position.

config ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE
	int "ZMS Storage lookup cache size"
	default 128
	range 1 65536
	depends on ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	help
	  Number of entries in ZMS lookup cache.
	  It is recommended that it should be a power of 2.
	  Every additional entry in cache will add 8 bytes in RAM

config ZMS_DATA_CRC
	bool "ZMS DATA CRC"
	help
	  Enables DATA CRC

config ZMS_CUSTOM_BLOCK_SIZE
	bool "Custom buffer size used by ZMS for reads and writes"
	default n
	help
	  ZMS uses internal buffers to read/write and compare stored data.
	  Increasing the size of these buffers should be done carefully in order to not
	  overflow the stack.
	  Increasing this buffer means as well that ZMS could work with storage devices
	  that have larger write-block-size which decreases ZMS performance

config ZMS_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
	int "ZMS internal buffer size"
	default 32
	depends on ZMS_CUSTOM_BLOCK_SIZE
	help
	  Changes the internal buffer size of ZMS
