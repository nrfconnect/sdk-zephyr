	  the state at least for 96 hours (Update in Progress has an
	  additional upper limit of 144 hours).

	  In order to fulfill the above requirement, even if the node might
	  be powered off once in a while, we need to store persistently
	  how many hours the node has been in the state. This doesn't
	  necessarily need to happen every hour (thanks to the flexible
	  duration range). The exact cadence will depend a lot on the
	  ways that the node will be used and what kind of power source it
	  has.

	  Since there is no single optimal answer, this configuration
	  option allows specifying a divider, i.e. how many intervals
	  the 96 hour minimum gets split into. After each interval the
	  duration that the node has been in the current state gets
