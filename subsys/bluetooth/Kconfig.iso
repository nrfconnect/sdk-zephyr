	int "Number of ISO TX fragment buffers"
	default 2
	range 0 255
	help
	  Number of buffers available for fragments of TX buffers. Warning:
	  setting this to 0 means that the application must ensure that
	  queued TX buffers never need to be fragmented, i.e. that the
	  controller's buffer size is large enough. If this is not ensured,
	  and there are no dedicated fragment buffers, a deadlock may occur.
	  In most cases the default value of 2 is a safe bet.
