config BT_PER_ADV
	bool "Periodic Advertising and Scanning support [EXPERIMENTAL]"
	help
	  Select this to enable Periodic Advertising API support. This allows
	  the device to send advertising data periodically at deterministic
	  intervals. Scanners can synchronize to the periodic advertisements
	  to periodically get the data.
