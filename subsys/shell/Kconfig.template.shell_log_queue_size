config $(module)_LOG_MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE

	  Amount of messages that can enqueued in order to be processed by shell
	  thread. Too small queue may lead to logger thread being blocked
	  (see $(module)_LOG_MESSAGE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT). Too big queue on relatively
	  slow shell transport may lead to situation where logs are dropped
	  because all log messages are enqueued.
