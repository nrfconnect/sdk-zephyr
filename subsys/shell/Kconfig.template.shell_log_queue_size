config $(module)_LOG_MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE
	int "Log message queue size"
	default $(default-size)
	help
	  Size of buffer for messages that can be enqueued in order to be processed
	  by shell thread. Too small queue may lead to the logger thread being blocked
	  (see $(module)_LOG_MESSAGE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT). Too big queue on relatively
	  slow shell transport may lead to situations where logs are dropped
	  because all log messages are enqueued.
