#   system, i.e. the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME would have if CMake would run
#   on the target system.  Typical examples are "Linux" and "Windows". This
#   variable is used for constructing the file names of the platform files
#   like Linux.cmake or Windows-gcc.cmake. If your target is an embedded
#   system without OS set CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME to "Generic".

#   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR : optional, processor (or hardware) of the

#   purpose, it is used to load a
#   CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME-compiler-CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.cmake file,
