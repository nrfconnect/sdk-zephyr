config BUILD_WITH_TFM
	bool "Build with TF-M as the Secure Execution Environment"
	depends on TRUSTED_EXECUTION_NONSECURE
	help
	  When enabled, this option instructs the Zephyr build process to
	  additionally generate a TF-M image for the Secure Execution
	  environment, along with the Zephyr image. The Zephyr image
	  itself is to be executed in the Non-Secure Processing Environment.
	  The required dependency on TRUSTED_EXECUTION_NONSECURE
	  ensures that the Zephyr image is built as a Non-Secure image. Both
	  TF-M and Zephyr images, as well as the veneer object file that links
	  them, are generated during the normal Zephyr build process.

	  Note:
	    Building with the "_nonsecure" BOARD variant (e.g.
	    "mps2_an521_nonsecure") ensures that
	    CONFIG_TRUSTED_EXECUTION_NONSECURE ie enabled.
