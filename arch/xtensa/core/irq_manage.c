 * The priority is verified if ASSERT_ON is enabled. The maximum number of
 * priority levels is a little complex, as there are some hardware priority
 * levels which are reserved: three for various types of exceptions, and
 * possibly one additional to support zero latency interrupts.
 *
 * Valid values are from 1 to 6. Interrupts of priority 1 are not masked when
 * interrupts are locked system-wide, so care must be taken when using them.
 * ISR installed with priority 0 interrupts cannot make kernel calls.
