# About the -include directive: The reason to do it this way, is because in this
# manner it is transparent to the application. Otherwise posix_cheats.h needs to
# be included in all the applications' files which define main( ), and in any
# app file which uses the pthreads like API provided by Zephyr
# ( include/posix/pthread.h / kernel/pthread.c ) [And any future API added to
# Zephyr which will clash with the native POSIX API] . It would also need to
# be included in a few zephyr kernel files.
