/**
 * @file  CPU power management code for IA-32
 *
 * This module provides an implementation of the architecture-specific
 * k_cpu_idle() primitive required by the kernel idle loop component.
 * It can be called within an implementation of _sys_power_save_idle(),
 * which is provided for the kernel by the platform.
 *
 * The module also provides an implementation of k_cpu_atomic_idle(), which
 * atomically re-enables interrupts and enters low power mode.
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * These implementations of k_cpu_idle() and k_cpu_atomic_idle() could be
 * used when operating as a Hypervisor guest.  More specifically, the Hypervisor
 * supports the execution of the 'hlt' instruction from a guest (results in a
 * VM exit), and more importantly, the Hypervisor will respect the
 * single instruction delay slot after the 'sti' instruction as required
 * by k_cpu_atomic_idle().

/**

 * @brief Atomically re-enable interrupts and enter low power mode
 *
 * INTERNAL
 * The requirements for k_cpu_atomic_idle() are as follows:
 * 1) The enablement of interrupts and entering a low-power mode needs to be
 *    atomic, i.e. there should be no period of time where interrupts are
 *    enabled before the processor enters a low-power mode.  See the comments
 *    in k_lifo_get(), for example, of the race condition that
 *    occurs if this requirement is not met.
 *
 * 2) After waking up from the low-power mode, the interrupt lockout state
 *    must be restored as indicated in the 'key' input parameter.
 *
 * @return N/A
