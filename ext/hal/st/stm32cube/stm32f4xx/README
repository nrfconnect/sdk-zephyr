Patch List:

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

   *Add correct shifting to I2SR field in PLLI2SCFGR register
     The I2SR field should be shifted by RCC_PLLI2SCFGR_PLLI2SR_Pos when the PLLI2SCFGR register
     is read or written.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32f4xx_ll_rcc.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 50086
