Description:
   This package is an extract of official STM32CubeF1 package written by ST Microelectronics.
   It is composed of STM32Cube hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and low layer (LL) plus a set
   of CMSIS headers files, one for each SoC in STM32F1 series.

Patch List:

   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

   *Disable i2c HAL
     Due to conflict with zephyr i2c.h (I2C_SPEED_STANDARD and I2C_SPEED_FAST
     redefinition), deactivate STM32Cube I2C HAL. This raises no issue since
     LL API is currently used for stm32 I2C driver.
     Impacted files:
      drivers/include/stm32f1xx_hal_conf.h
     ST Bug tracker ID: NA. Not a stm32cube issue

    *Update LSI_VALUE to 40 KHz
     Impacted files:
      drivers/include/stm32f1xx_ll_rcc.h
     ST Bug tracker ID: 37419

    *Use of (__packed uint32_t *) produces warning
      Using GNU 8.2.0, (__packed uint32_t *) generates warning.
      Replace with CMSIS macros __UNALIGNED_UINT32_READ and
      __UNALIGNED_UINT32_WRITE.
     Impacted files:
      drivers/include/stm32f1xx_ll_usb.c
     ST Bug tracker ID: 61323

    *Fix warnings for extraneous parentheses
      Using clang 7.0.1, if ((htim->State == HAL_TIM_STATE_BUSY))
      generates warnings.  Remove the extra parentheses
     Impacted files:
