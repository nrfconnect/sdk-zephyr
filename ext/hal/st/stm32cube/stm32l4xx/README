Patch List:

   *Current implementation of LL_SPI_TransmitData16 on F3/F7/L4 family
    generates following warning:
    "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
    rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]"
    Besides being forbidden by rule, this cast is not needed, as register is
    16 bits wide. Modification has been tested on L4 SoC.
    stm32yyxx_ll_spi.h being included in soc.h file, warning is generated
    at each compiled object, this commit allows a clean build.
    Impacted files:
     drivers/include/stm32l4xx_ll_spi.h
    ST Bug tracker ID: 13359
