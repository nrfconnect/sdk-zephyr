Patch List:

    * The STM32L4x2 SoCs need to control the isolation of the USB features
    from VDDUSB. This is done through the PWR_CR2 bit USV. The STM32L4 HAL
    in stm32l4xx_ll_pwr.h wrongly checks for the PWR_CR2_PVME1 bit, which
    is only available on Cat. 3 devices. Replace the check by PWR_CR2_USV.

   *Disable new CAN API and enable Legacy API
     A new CAN API has been delivered on recent L4 stm32cube.
     This new API breaks current CAN driver. Disable the new API and enable the
     legacy API.
     Disable related systematic warning message

   *Fix LL_EXTI_LINE_18 and LL_EXTI_LINE_20 declarations
     LL_EXTI_LINE_18 and LL_EXTI_LINE_20 are declared in stm32l4xx_hal_pcd.h
     and in stm32l4xx_ll_exti.h which generates warnings. Set #ifndef
     in stm32l4xx_ll_exti.h around declarations.

    *Use of (__packed uint32_t *) produces warning
      Using GNU 8.2.0, (__packed uint32_t *) generates warning.
      Replace with CMSIS macros __UNALIGNED_UINT32_READ and
      __UNALIGNED_UINT32_WRITE.

    *Fix warnings for extraneous parentheses
      Using clang 7.0.1, if ((htim->State == HAL_TIM_STATE_BUSY))
      generates warnings.  Remove the extra parentheses
