   *Changes from official delivery:
    -dos2unix applied
    -trailing white spaces removed

    *Update LSI_VALUE to 40 KHz

     ST Bug tracker ID: 37418

    *Current implementation of LL_SPI_TransmitData16 on F3/F7/L4 family
     generates following warning:
      "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing
      rules [-Wstrict-aliasing]"
     Besides being forbidden by rule, this cast is not needed, as register is
     16 bits wide. Modification has been tested on L4 SoC.
     stm32yyxx_ll_spi.h being included in soc.h file, warning is generated
     at each compiled object, this commit allows a clean build.
