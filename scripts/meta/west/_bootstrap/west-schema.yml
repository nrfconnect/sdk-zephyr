## A pykwalify schema for basic validation of the structure of a
## west YAML file.  (Full validation would require additional work,
## e.g. to validate that remote URLs obey the URL format specified in
## rfc1738.)
##

# The top-level west yaml is a map. The only top-level element is
# 'west'. All other elements are contained within it. This allows
# us a bit of future-proofing.
