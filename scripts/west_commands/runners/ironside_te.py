RECOVER_REFUSED = f'''--recover is not available on a target running IronSide TE.

It is an unauthenticated mass erase and unlock, with no version of it scoped to
the application: an unprotected device would lose IronSide TE along with
everything else, and a protected device refuses it outright.

Reinstalling IronSide TE is what brings a device back:

  {REINSTALL}'''

ERASE_KEPT = f'''
IronSide TE is left intact, unlike normal --erase: the roots of trust, their
secure storage, the DFU agent, the write-once UICR configuration and the KMU,
the persistent keys, the OTA key-encryption keys and the rollback counters
all survive. An image below the resident security counter is therefore still
refused after this erase. To clear that too, reinstall IronSide TE:

  {REINSTALL}'''

PROTECTED = f'''Flashing failed because the target is protected.

A protected device refuses erases that are not authenticated. A reinstall
issues an authenticated one before it programs anything, and needs the keyset
the device was provisioned with, named by --keyset:

  {REINSTALL} --keyset <keyset>'''

UICR_IN_IMAGE = f'''The image has data in the UICR region and the verify failed,
which usually means the UICR was not erased first. Here it cannot be: the UICR
configuration belongs to IronSide TE.'''

    Flashing is unchanged from the nrfutil runner. What differs is the reach of
    the two options that erase beyond the image: a chip erase and a recover
    would both take IronSide TE and the write-once UICR configuration with
    them, leaving a device that only a reinstall brings back.
