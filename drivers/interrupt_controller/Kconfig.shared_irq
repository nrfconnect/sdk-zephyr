menuconfig SHARED_IRQ
	bool
	prompt "Shared interrupt driver"
	help
	 Include shared interrupt support in system. Shared interrupt
	 support is NOT required in most systems. If in doubt answer no.

config SHARED_IRQ_NUM_CLIENTS
	int
	depends on SHARED_IRQ
	prompt "The number of clients per instance"
	default 5
	help
	 Configures the maximum number of clients allowed per shared
	 instance of the shared interrupt driver. To conserve RAM set
	 this value to the lowest practical value.

	prompt "Shared IRQ init priority"
	help
	 Shared IRQ are initialized on POST_KERNEL init level. They
	 have to be initialized before any device that uses them.

config SHARED_IRQ_0
	bool "Shared interrupt instance 0"
	depends on SHARED_IRQ
	help
	 Provide an instance of the shared interrupt driver when system
	 configuration requires that multiple devices share an interrupt.

	default 2
	depends on SHARED_IRQ_0
	help
	 Priority of shared interrupt handler for the configured interrupt

	bool "Falling Edge"
	help
	  Interrupt triggers on falling edge.

config SHARED_IRQ_0_RISING_EDGE
	bool "Rising Edge"
	help
	  Interrupt triggers on rising edge.
