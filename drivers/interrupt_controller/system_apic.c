 * based on the given IRQ parameter.
 *
 * Drivers call this routine instead of IRQ_CONNECT() when interrupts are
 * configured statically.
 *
 * The Galileo board virtualizes IRQs as follows:
 *
 * - The first CONFIG_IOAPIC_NUM_RTES IRQs are provided by the IOAPIC so the
 *     IOAPIC is programmed for these IRQs
 * - The remaining IRQs are provided by the LOAPIC and hence the LOAPIC is
 *     programmed.
 *
 * @param vector the vector number
 * @param irq the virtualized IRQ
 * @param flags interrupt flags
