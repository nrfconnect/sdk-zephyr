	  Defines the maximum number of filters with standard ID (11-bit)
	  that can be added by the application.

	  One standard ID filter with mask occupies 1/2 of the 14 available
	  filter banks.

	  The following equation determines the maximum total number of
	  filters:

	    CAN_MAX_STD_ID_FILTER + CAN_MAX_EXT_ID_FILTER * 2 <= 28

	int "Maximum number of ext ID filters"

	  Defines the maximum number of filters with extended ID (29-bit)
	  that can be added by the application.

	  One extended ID filter with mask occupies 1 of the 14 available
	  filter banks.

	  The following equation determines the maximum total number of
	  filters:

	    CAN_MAX_STD_ID_FILTER + CAN_MAX_EXT_ID_FILTER * 2 <= 28
