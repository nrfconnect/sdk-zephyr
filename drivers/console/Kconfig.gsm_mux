	  The muxing protocol allows GSM modem to share the same UART for both
	  the PPP data and AT commands.

config GSM_MUX_MAX
	int "Max number of GSM mux instances"
	default 1
	depends on GSM_MUX
	help
	  Usually we only need one GSM mux instance. You need to increase
	  this if you have more than one GSM modems.

config GSM_MUX_DLCI_MAX
	int "Max number of GSM data link connection (DLC) instances"
	default 3
	range 1 64
	depends on GSM_MUX
	help
	  For our purposes we will manage with 3 DLCI (control, ppp, and AT
	  commands) so making it the default value. If GSM modem also provides
	  GNSS (location) services and you want to create a DLCI for it, then
	  you need to increase this to 4.

config GSM_MUX_DLCI_AT
	int "DLCI id of the AT commands channel"
	default 2 if MODEM_GSM_SIMCOM
	default 1
	range 1 63

	help
	  Channel number for the AT commands to the modem.

	default 1 if MODEM_GSM_SIMCOM
	default 2
	range 1 63
	depends on GSM_MUX
	help
	  Channel number for the PPP connection to the modem.
	  SIMCOM modem has 16kb buffer for DLCI 1 so the manual recommends
	  it for PPP traffic. For other DLCIs in that modem, the buffer size
	  is only 1kb.

config GSM_MUX_PENDING_CMD_MAX
	int "Max number of pending GSM mux commands"
	default 2
	range 1 8

	  How many pending GSM mux commands can exists.

	depends on GSM_MUX
	help
	  Default MRU (Maximum Receive Unit) data size. The default
	  value for Basic mode is 31 bytes. The 1509 limit comes from
	  ublox-sara modem and it means we can transfer full Ethernet sized
	  frame and muxing headers.

config GSM_MUX_MRU_MAX_LEN
	int "Max size of received user data (MRU)"
	default 255 if MODEM_GSM_SIMCOM

	  Max MRU (Maximum Receive Unit) data size. The default max
	  value for Basic mode is 128 bytes.

config GSM_MUX_INITIATOR
	bool "Are we the initiator of the connection"
	default y
	depends on GSM_MUX
	help
	  Default value when deciding whether we are the initiator of the
	  connection attempt. Normally this should be enabled.

config GSM_MUX_T1_TIMEOUT
	int "T1 timeout in ms"
	default 0
	range 0 5000
	depends on GSM_MUX
	help
	  T1 timeout is initial command timeout when establishing
	  the connection. The value is in milliseconds. Zero value
	  means that default (100 ms) specified in the code is used.
