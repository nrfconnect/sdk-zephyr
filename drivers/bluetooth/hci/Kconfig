	  Bluetooth H:4 UART driver. Requires hardware flow control
	  lines to be available.

	  Bluetooth three-wire (H:5) UART driver. Implementation of HCI
	  Three-Wire UART Transport Layer.

config BT_RPMSG
	bool "HCI using RPMsg"
	help
	  Bluetooth HCI driver for communication with another CPU
	  using RPMsg framework.

config BT_SPI
	bool "SPI HCI"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Supports Bluetooth ICs using SPI as the communication protocol.
	  HCI packets are sent and received as single Byte transfers,
	  prepended after a known header.  Headers may vary per device, so
	  additional platform specific knowledge may need to be added as
	  devices are.

config BT_USERCHAN
	bool "HCI User Channel based driver"
	depends on BOARD_NATIVE_POSIX
	help
	  This driver provides access to the local Linux host's Bluetooth
	  adapter using a User Channel HCI socket to the Linux kernel. It
	  is only intended to be used with the native POSIX build of Zephyr.
	  The Bluetooth adapter must be powered off in order for Zephyr to
	  be able to use it.

config BT_NO_DRIVER
	bool "No default HCI driver"
	help
	  This is intended for unit tests where no internal driver
	  should be selected.
