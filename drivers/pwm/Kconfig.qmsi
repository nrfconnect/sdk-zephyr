menuconfig PWM_QMSI
	bool "QMSI PWM Driver"
	depends on QMSI && PWM
	help
	  Enable QMSI PWM driver. This driver will use the QMSI library to
	  access the SOC underlying timer IP block. This driver uses the
	  DesignWare IP block that can be also handled by the PWM_DW driver

config PWM_QMSI_DEV_NAME
	string "QMSI PWM Device Name"
	depends on PWM_QMSI
	default "PWM_0"
	help
	  Specify the device name for the PWM driver.

config PWM_QMSI_NUM_PORTS
	int "Number of PWM ports for PWM"
	depends on PWM_QMSI
	default 1
	help
	  Specify how many PWM ports on the IP block.

config PWM_QMSI_API_REENTRANCY
	bool
	prompt "PWM shim driver API reentrancy"
	depends on PWM_QMSI
	help
	  Enable support for PWM shim driver API reentrancy.
