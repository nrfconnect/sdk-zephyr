	bool "Emulated GPIO driver"
	help
	  Enable the emulated GPIO driver. Mainly used for testing, this
	  driver allows for an arbitrary number of emulated GPIO controllers
	  to be instantiated. Furthermore, the emulated pins can be "wired"
	  using the regular GPIO callback API and the additional API
	  available in drivers/gpio/gpio_emul.h . Configuration for each
	  GPIO instance is accomplished using device tree and an example of
	  such a configuration is in
	  tests/drivers/gpio/gpio_basic_api/boards/native_posix_64.overlay
	  If unsure, say N.
