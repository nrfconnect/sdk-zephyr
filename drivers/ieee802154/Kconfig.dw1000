	help
	  SNIFF on time in unit of PAC. The minimum on time is the duration
	  of two PACs. The SNIFF counter always adds 1 PAC unit to the on-time
	  count. The SNIFF_ONT value should be in range of 1-15.
	  Zero value disables SNIFF mode.

	int "SNIFF off time"

	range 1 $(UINT8_MAX)
	help
	  SNIFF off time in unit of approximate 1 microsecond.

config IEEE802154_DW1000_INIT_PRIO
	int "DW1000 initialization priority"
	default 80
	help
	  Set the initialization priority number. Do not mess with it unless
	  you know what you are doing. Beware DW1000 requires gpio and spi to
	  be ready first (and sometime gpio should be the very first as spi
	  might need it too). And of course it has to start before the net stack.
