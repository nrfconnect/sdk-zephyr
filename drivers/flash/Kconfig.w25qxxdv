	int
	default 80
	help
	  Device driver initialization priority.
	  Device is connected to SPI bus, it has to
	  be initialized after SPI driver.

config SPI_FLASH_W25QXXDV_SPI_FREQ_0
	int "SPI system frequency"
	default 8000000
	help
	  This option sets the SPI controller's frequency. Beware this value
	  depends on the SPI controller being used and also on the system
	  clock.

config SPI_FLASH_W25QXXDV_SPI_SLAVE
	int "SPI slave linked to SPI flash"
	help
	  This option sets the SPI slave number the SPI controller has to switch
	  to when dealing with WinBond SPI flash chip.

config SPI_FLASH_W25QXXDV_GPIO_SPI_CS
	bool "Manage SPI CS through a GPIO pin"
	help
	This option is useful if one needs to manage SPI CS through a GPIO
	pin to by-pass the SPI controller's CS logic.

	string "GPIO driver's name to use to drive SPI CS through"
	default ""
	depends on SPI_FLASH_W25QXXDV_GPIO_SPI_CS
	help
	This option is mandatory to set which GPIO controller to use in order
	to actually emulate the SPI CS.

	int "GPIO PIN to use to drive SPI CS through"
	default 0

	This option is mandatory to set which GPIO pin to use in order
	to actually emulate the SPI CS.

        depends on SPI_FLASH_W25QXXDV_GPIO_SPI_CS
	help
	This is the wait delay (in us) to allow for CS switching to take effect

	help
	  This is the device ID of the flash chip to use, which is 0x00ef4015 for
          the W25QXXDV
