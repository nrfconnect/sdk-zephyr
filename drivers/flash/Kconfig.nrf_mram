	  Enables Nordic Semiconductor flash driver for MRAM in direct write mode.

	  Note that MRAM words are auto-erased when written to, but writing to a
	  pre-erased area is faster. Hence, the erase API is not required, but
	  it can be used to amortize write performance for some use cases.

	int "Maximum number of retries for MRAM write/erase operations"

	help
	  This option sets the maximum number of retry attempts for MRAM
	  write and erase operations when verification fails. Each retry
	  attempts to rewrite or re-erase the data to ensure reliability.
	  Higher values increase reliability but may impact performance
	  in case of persistent failures.
