	depends on SPI
	help
		Enable LED strip driver for daisy chains of LPD880x
		(LPD8803, LPD8806, or compatible) devices.

		Each LPD880x LED driver chip has some output channels
		(3 channels for LPD8803, 6 for LPD8806), whose PWM
		duty cycle can be set at 7 bit resolution via a
		reduced SPI interface (MOSI and CLK lines only).
		Each chip also includes data and clock out pins for
		daisy chaining LED strips.

	default ""
	help
		Specify the device name of the SPI master which the
		LPD880X driver should use to control the LED strip.
		Examples: SPI_0, SPI_1, etc.

	int "Strip clock line frequency"
	default 2000000
	help
		SPI clock rate, in Hz, to use while driving the strip.
		The recommended maximum is 2 MHz (2000000); the absolute maximum
		is 20 MHz (20000000). If unsure, accept the default value.
