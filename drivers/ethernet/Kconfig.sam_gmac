	  Device name allows user to obtain a handle to the device object
	  required by all driver API functions. Device name has to be unique.

config ETH_SAM_GMAC_BUF_RX_COUNT
	int "Network RX buffers preallocated by the SAM ETH driver"
	default 18
	help
	  Number of network buffers that will be permanently allocated by the
	  Ethernet driver. These buffers are used in receive path. They are
	  preallocated by the driver and made available to the GMAC module to be
	  filled in with incoming data. Their number has to be large enough to fit
	  at least one complete Ethernet frame. SAM ETH driver will always allocate
	  that amount of buffers for itself thus reducing the NET_BUF_RX_COUNT
	  which is a total amount of RX data buffers used by the whole networking
	  stack. One has to ensure that NET_PKT_RX_COUNT is large enough to
	  fit at least two Ethernet frames: one being received by the GMAC module
	  and the other being processed by the higher layer networking stack.
