	  This option enables the test random number generator for the
	  native_posix board (ARCH_POSIX). This is based on the host random() API.
	  Note that this entropy generator is only meant for test purposes and does
	  not generate real entropy.
	  It actually generates always the same sequence of random numbers if
	  initialized with the same seed.
